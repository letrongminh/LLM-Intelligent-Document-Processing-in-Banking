Introduction  \\nThis report provides a n overview of residential mortgage lending in 2023 based on the data \\ncollected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) . HMDA  is a data collection, \\nreporting, and disclosure statute enacted in 1975. HMDA data are used to assist in determining \\nwhether financial institutions are serving the housing  credit  needs of their local communities; \\nfacilitate public entities’ distribution of funds to local communities to attract private investment; and help identify possible discriminatory lending patterns  and enfo rce antidiscrimination \\nstatu tes.\\n1 Institutions covered by HMDA are required to collect and report specified information \\nabout each mortgage application acted upon and mortgage purchased. The data include the disposition of each application for mortgage credit; the type, purpose, and characteristics of each home mortgage application or purchased loan; the census -tract designations of the \\nproperties; loan pricing information; demographic and other information about loan applicants, such as their race, ethnicity, sex , age, and income; and information about loan sales.\\n2  \\nThe 2023 HMDA data3 are the sixth  year of data that incorporate  amendments made to HMDA  \\nby the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010  (DFA) . On July 11 , \\n2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) published  a static application- level \\n2023 HMDA data file that  consolidates data from individual reporters, called the “Snapshot \\nNational Loan- Level Data .”4 The data file  is modified  to protect applicant and borrower \\nprivacy .5 The data file reflect s 2023 mortgage  data as  of May  1, 2024 and is used for the analysis \\nin this report . Though this static file will  not change, the CFPB will also provide an update d file \\nseparately to reflect any later resubmissions or late submissions. Th e results using the updated \\nfile may differ from those  reported in this report , although the CFPB expect s them to be  largely \\nconsistent . \\n \\n* This report was authored by Feng Liu, Young Jo, Noah Cohen -Harding, and Isabelle Caldwell  (CFPB \\nOffice of Research).  \\n1 For a brief history of HMDA, see  Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, “History of \\nHMDA ,” available at www.ffiec.gov/hmda/history2.htm  (last modified Sept. 06, 2018) .  \\n2 See Filing instructions guide for HMDA data collected in 20 22 (November 2020), available at \\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/cfpb -hmda -public/prod/help/2022 -hmda -fig.pdf  for a full list of items \\nreported under HMDA for 2022 . \\n3 The 2023 HMDA data cover mortgage applications acted upon and mortgages purchased during the \\n2023 calendar year and reported in 202 4. Similarly, the 2018 , 2019 , 2020 , 2021  and 202 2 HMDA data \\nrefer to applications acted upon,  and mortgages purchased during the calendar years of 2018 , 2019 , 2020, \\n2021 , and 2022,  respectively.  \\n4 See https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data -publication/snapshot -national-loan -level -dataset/2023 .  \\n5 For more information concerning these modifications and the CFPB’s analyses under the balancing test \\nit adopted to protect applicant and borrower privacy while also fulfilling HMDA’s disclosure purposes, see \\nDisclosure of Loan -Level HMDA  Data  84 FR 649 (Jan . 31, 2019 ).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3352, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The monthly average \\ninterest rates for 30 -year fixed -rate closed -end conventional conforming loans originated to \\nprime borrowers secured by first- lien principal residence increased from 6.238 in January to \\n7.169 by December of 2023.

Moreover , the rising  interest rate led to \\nhigher monthly mortgage payments , potentially shifting the com position of home purchase \\nborrowers to higher income borrowers.  Some of the key findings are:6 \\n• The total number of applications and originations dropped significantly in \\n2023.  The number of applications and originations continued their downward trend in \\n2023,  with the number of applications decreasing by about 4.3 million or 30.3 percent \\nand originations decreasing by 2.7 million or 32.2 percent from 2022. The origination \\nvolum e in 2023 stood only at about 37.9 percent of its recent peak in 2021.  \\n• Refinance originations dropped by more than half  since 2022, and home \\npurchase originations dropped by less than one third.  Lenders reported \\napproximately 3.2 million closed -end site -built one -to-four family (single -family) home \\npurchase originations in 2023, a 21.3 percent decrease from 4.1 million originations in 2022.\\n  The closed -end site -built single -family refinance originations fell from 2.2 million \\nin 2022 to 796,000 in 2023, which was a reduction of 64.2 percent. Most of the refinance \\noriginations l eft in the market were a small number of cash -out refinance loans.  \\n• More than half of all  borrowers pa id discount points , a 12.7 percent increase \\nfrom 2022 . Among the first lien closed -end home purchase loans secured by a single -\\nfamily principal residence and not for commercial/business purpose, about 56.6 percent \\nof loans paid some discount points in 2023, which was a 12.7 percent increase from \\n2022. The median discount points paid for home purchase loans were $3,000 and that \\nfor refinance loans were $3,902 in 2023, which were a 26.6 percent and a 35.6 percent increase fro m a year ago. This report does not analyze the impact of paying discount \\npoints on interest rate reductions or total loan costs.  \\n• Total loan costs, which include origination fees and discount points, also \\nincreased between 2022 and 2023, with faster increases for Hispanic white \\nand Black borrowers . The median total loan costs for home purchase loans in 2023 \\nwas $6,684, up by 12.2 percent from $5,954 in 2022. The median total loan costs for \\nrefinance loans reached $7,329 in 2023, compared to $4,979 in 2022– a 47.2 percent \\n \\n6  This report is based on the  analysis of the  static consolidated application -level 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, \\n2022, and 2023  HMDA data file s.

      "With my extensive experience in the industry spanning nearly two decades, I’m here to guide you through the complexities of the current [home loan](https://www.quantumfinance.com.au/home-loans/) industry, property, and consumer behaviour trends in Australia as we head into 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "This blog breaks down these topics into simple, easy-to-understand content, drawing from my years of expertise and expert analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Home Loan Trends**: Growth in digital lending, increasing importance of mortgage brokers, a shift towards refinancing, and changes in borrowing power.\n",
      "- **Property Market Trends**: Variable house price movements, resilience in specific markets, popularity of urban units, and regional markets outperforming major cities.\n",

      "\n",
      "These trends demonstrate a complex interplay of economic factors influencing consumer behaviour in Australia, indicating a more cautious, value-driven, and environmentally conscious consumer base as we move into 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "01. **Streamlined Application Processes with Digital Lenders**: The home loan landscape is evolving with digital lenders [simplifying application processes](https://www.finder.com.au/3-things-future-home-loans-2023). This shift towards automated assessments and online applications makes it easier for borrowers, especially those with straightforward financial situations, to navigate the lending process without the need for extensive paperwork​​.\n",
      "02. **Increased Role of Mortgage Brokers**: Mortgage brokers have become increasingly important in the home loan landscape. As of late 2022, [69.3% of all new residential home loans](https://www.finder.com.au/3-things-future-home-loans-2023) were facilitated by brokers. This trend is driven by the complexity and diversity of products in the market, indicating that brokers are key for consumers seeking expert guidance and access to a wider range of loan products​​.\n",
      "03. **Trend Towards Refinancing and Shift in Borrowing Power**: With [rising interest rates](https://www.finder.com.au/3-things-future-home-loans-2023), many Australians are likely to consider refinancing in 2023. This trend is a response to the changing economic landscape, and borrowers need to weigh the potential savings against fees and switching costs​​.\n",
      "04. **Growth in Home Lending**: Home lending experienced a [significant increase in October 2023](https://www.afr.com/property/residential/false-dawn-of-interest-rate-hopes-pushes-home-loans-up-in-october-20231204-p5eouz), with a 5.4% rise in new lending commitments. This uptick was the first year-on-year growth in almost 18 months, indicating renewed strength in the market. This trend began in March 2023 and showed the fastest growth in owner-occupier finance since November 2021​​.\n",
      "05. **Changes in Average Mortgage Sizes**: The average mortgage size in Australia saw [varied changes across different states](https://mozo.com.au/home-loans/articles/what-is-the-average-mortgage-in-australia). For instance, New South Wales experienced a 3.7% increase in average mortgage size, while Victoria saw a 1.9% decrease. These regional variations reflect the impact of property prices and market conditions on borrowing​​.\n",
      "06. **National Home Prices Recovery**: It is anticipated that national home prices will [start to recover](https://www.yourmortgage.com.au/mortgage-news/market-trends-first-home-buyers-must-watch) from the second quarter of 2023. This recovery is expected to be driven by the limited supply of houses available for sale​​.\n",
      "07. **First-Home Buyers Entering NSW Property Market**: The introduction of schemes like the First Home Buyer Choice in New South Wales is likely to encourage [more first-home buyers](https://www.yourmortgage.com.au/mortgage-news/market-trends-first-home-buyers-must-watch) to enter the market. This trend is facilitated by alternatives to upfront stamp duty, making it easier for first-time buyers to purchase homes​​.\n",
      "08. **Interest Rates Balancing Out**: There is speculation that [interest rates may stabilise](https://www.yourmortgage.com.au/mortgage-news/market-trends-first-home-buyers-must-watch) or even decrease towards the end of 2023. This change would be a response to the aggressive rate hikes observed previously, and it could influence borrowers’ decisions and market dynamics​​.\n",
      "09. **Banks Reviewing Lending Requirements**: With the changing economic environment, [banks might revise their lending requirements](https://www.yourmortgage.com.au/mortgage-news/market-trends-first-home-buyers-must-watch). This could be a response to decreased borrowing capacity and fewer loan applications, leading to more accommodating lending criteria​​.\n",
      "10. **Regional Centres Remaining Hotspots for Buying Activity**: Smaller regional centres in Australia are expected to [continue being attractive for home buyers](https://www.yourmortgage.com.au/mortgage-news/market-trends-first-home-buyers-must-watch), owing to their affordability and robust local economies. These areas may see sustained demand from buyers, offering opportunities for both first-time buyers and investors​​. to vector\n",

      "These trends highlight a dynamic and evolving home loan market in Australia, influenced by economic factors, technological advancements, and policy changes. As we head into 2024, these trends suggest a market that is adapting to new challenges and opportunities, with significant implications for borrowers, lenders, and the broader economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **High Demand, Low Supply:** Housing affordability is expected to continue to be an issue. For example, in WA, in the 12 months leading up to March 2023, around [11,121 people moved to WA](https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/the-perth-suburbs-set-to-profit-from-wa-s-interstate-migration-surge-20230914-p5e4o0.html) from other states, with 26,005 coming in just three months, meaning we needed about [320 new homes each week](https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-housing-crisis-1000-people-moved-to-wa-every-week-in-2022-putting-pressure-on-housing-c-10987797) to keep up. Some [studies show](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046223000285) that a 1% increase in the number of people coming to WA can make house prices go up by 3.3%.\n",
      "2. **Variable House Price Movements**: The Australian property market shows a [mix of rising and declining house prices](https://www.prd.com.au/research-hub/article/australia-economic-and-property-report-2023/) across various regions. While some areas continue to experience price growth, others face declining prices. This variability is influenced by multiple factors, including cash rates, supply-demand dynamics, and local market conditions. Notably, Greater Hobart and Greater Brisbane have seen substantial median house price growth between pre-COVID-19 times and mid-2023​​.\n",
      "3. **Resilience in Specific Markets**: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and notable regional centres like the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast have shown [downturns](https://thepropertytribune.com.au/market-insights/top-5-australian-property-market-trends-for-2023/) even before the Reserve Bank of Australia’s rate actions in May. Despite this, certain areas like Greater Brisbane and Greater Perth have shown resilience in their markets. This trend highlights the complexities and varying impacts on local property markets​​.\n",
      "4. **Increasing Popularity of Units in Urban Areas**: In city areas offering units at substantial discounts compared to house prices, there has been an [increase in demand](https://thepropertytribune.com.au/market-insights/top-5-australian-property-market-trends-for-2023/). This trend is notable in Sydney, where despite a general decline, certain inner-city unit precincts are showing resilience. This is likely influenced by factors such as returning overseas migrants and students, which increases demand for rental units​​.\n",
      "5. **Regional Markets Outperforming Major Cities**: Regional areas, particularly in Queensland, are proving [more prominent than the largest Australian cities](https://thepropertytribune.com.au/market-insights/top-5-australian-property-market-trends-for-2023/) in the property market. Townsville in regional Queensland is highlighted for its performance. The shift towards regional markets reflects a broader trend of buyers seeking affordability and lifestyle changes​​.\n",
      "6. **Impact of Economic and Consumer Sentiment**: While economic factors such as interest rates, inflation, and unemployment continue to play a significant role in the property market, [consumer sentiment is also a major driver](https://www.openagent.com.au/news/2023-australian-property-market-outlook). Improved auction clearance rates and a shift in buyer confidence suggest a more balanced market, particularly for high-quality properties in popular areas​​.\n",
      "7. **Property Market Recovery**: The property market is moving into a [recovery phase](https://propertyupdate.com.au/australian-property-market-predictions/). Despite predictions of distress sales due to the ‘fixed interest rate cliff’, actual data shows a decrease in distressed listings in capital cities. This indicates underlying strength in the market and a rebound from the previous downturns​​.\n",
      "8. **Local Factors Driving Real Estate Trends**: Real estate is significantly influenced by local factors, with [varying impacts across different regions](https://thepropertytribune.com.au/market-insights/top-5-australian-property-market-trends-for-2023/). For instance, regional Queensland shows a mix of rising, consistent, plateau, and declining markets, underscoring the importance of understanding local market conditions​​. to vector\n",

      "\n",
      "In summary, the Australian property market in 2024 is expected to be influenced by a complex interplay of economic factors, consumer sentiment, regional preferences, and local market dynamics. While some areas are showing signs of recovery and growth, others continue to experience challenges, indicating a diverse and evolving landscape across the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "01. **Increased Consciousness in Spending**: Australians are exhibiting more price-driven behaviour than before. About [47% of consumers are now opting for lower-priced brands](https://lens.monash.edu/@business-economy/2023/05/18/1385768/cost-of-living-squeeze-how-australians-are-changing-their-spending-and-retail-habits), a significant change from previous years. This shift indicates a strong focus on managing expenditures amidst rising costs​​.\n",
      "02. **Decline in Retail Sales Volumes**: There has been a notable drop in retail sales volumes, with a [0.6% decrease in March 2023](https://lens.monash.edu/@business-economy/2023/05/18/1385768/cost-of-living-squeeze-how-australians-are-changing-their-spending-and-retail-habits). This decline is the largest non-pandemic related fall since the September quarter of 2009, marking a significant shift in consumer spending patterns​​.\n",
      "03. **Rising Costs Impacting Consumer Choices**: The cost of groceries and grocery-related products has risen, with [67% of Australians](https://lens.monash.edu/@business-economy/2023/05/18/1385768/cost-of-living-squeeze-how-australians-are-changing-their-spending-and-retail-habits) feeling these items cost more than in the previous year. This has led to a 49% increase in grocery spending, reflecting the impact of inflation on essential goods​​.\n",
      "04. **Changing Attitudes Toward Apparel Spending**: [Over half of consumers](https://lens.monash.edu/@business-economy/2023/05/18/1385768/cost-of-living-squeeze-how-australians-are-changing-their-spending-and-retail-habits) (55%) feel that apparel, including clothing, footwear, and accessories, costs more than last year. The spending in this category is evenly split, with 27% spending more and 29% spending less​​.\n",
      "05. **Growth in Health and Transport Spending**: There’s been a significant increase in spending in specific categories. [Transport expenditure rose by 13.4%](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/finance/monthly-household-spending-indicator/latest-release), and health-related spending increased by 10.8%, indicating shifts in priorities and needs​​.\n",
      "06. **Focus on Value for Money**: As inflation continues, [48% of consumers are buying less](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/australian-consumer-sentiment-snapshot-7), focusing on functional needs over experience. Value for money has become a key priority across various spending categories, from food to home goods​​.\n",
      "07. **Increased Online Price Checking**: Approximately [60% of consumers](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/australian-consumer-sentiment-snapshot-7) are now checking prices online more than ever, a 10 percentage point increase from November 2022. This trend signifies the growing importance of digital platforms in consumer decision-making processes​​.\n",
      "08. **Preference for Deals and Discounts**: A considerable number of consumers (56%) are hunting for deals and discounts, [up 8 percentage points from November 2022](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/australian-consumer-sentiment-snapshot-7). This trend highlights the changing shopping habits in an inflationary environment​​.\n",
      "09. **Sustainability and Locally Produced Products**: There is a [growing interest in sustainability](https://lens.monash.edu/@business-economy/2023/05/18/1385768/cost-of-living-squeeze-how-australians-are-changing-their-spending-and-retail-habits), with 35% of consumers shopping more for locally produced products and 30% for environmentally-friendly products. This change indicates a shift towards more conscious and responsible consumption​​.\n",
      "10. **Deferred Purchases Amidst Economic Pressures**: A notable [50% of consumers are deferring purchases](https://lens.monash.edu/@business-economy/2023/05/18/1385768/cost-of-living-squeeze-how-australians-are-changing-their-spending-and-retail-habits) until sales or special deals, and 43% are deferring purchases indefinitely.

      "In the upcoming 2024 landscape, key trends are shaping the Australian market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home loan trends show a surge in digital lending, a growing reliance on mortgage brokers, a notable shift towards refinancing, and altered borrowing power dynamics.

      "percent and originations decreasing by 2.7 million or 32.2 percent. The significant decline occurred in both home purchase and refinance lending  but was mo re prominent in refinanc e, \n",
      "with t he closed -end site -built single -family refinance originations decreasing  by 64.2 percent \n",
      "from a year ago. The decline continued throughout the year. By the end of 202 3, the only  \n",
      "refinance originations left in the market were a small number of cash -out refinance loans.  There \n",
      "was an increase in denial rates year -to-year for both home purchase and refinance applications.  \n",

Throughout 2024, the Federal Reserve maintained a relatively high federal funds rate, aiming to curb inflation without triggering a major economic downturn([1)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm). The federal funds rate averaged around 5.25%–5.5% throughout the year, a level intended to slow economic activity gradually and reduce inflation([2)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm).\\n\\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFTCaXx_EGZcw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1735047172634?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jcjs1uIdMofWaLW6mx0BP4Y4HBJvUwqhTat_pgg0CPw)](https://admortgage.com/loyalty-program/?utm_source=li&utm_medium=sm&utm_campaign=loyalty-program)\\n\\nThis rate environment had a direct impact on mortgage rates, which remained elevated relative to pre-2022 levels. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate closed the year at approximately 6.8%([3)](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms). Though slightly below the peaks seen in 2023, these rates continued to pressure buyers and limit affordability for many. The effects were particularly felt by first-time homebuyers, whose purchasing power was constrained by both high borrowing costs and ongoing home price appreciation. \\nContent: ## 2\\\\. Interest Rates and Affordability in 2024 \\nContent: ## Key takeaways\\n\\n- The first quarter of the year is typically quiet for the housing market, but this year might buck the typical trends.\\n\\n- Experts do not expect home prices to drop significantly in the first quarter of 2025, due to high demand and low inventory.\\n\\n- Mortgage rates are expected to drop slightly, but likely not enough to make a meaningful impact in the market.\\n\\n\\nThe New Year is upon us, and it couldn’t have come at a better time for many [home shoppers](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-to-buy-a-house/) and real estate players eager to turn the calendar page and say goodbye to 2024’s challenging market — a period when home prices climbed ever higher and mortgage rates swung up, then tantalizingly down, then deflatingly back up again.\\n\\nAccording to the latest National Association of Realtors (NAR) data, the median [existing-home sales](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/existing-home-sales/) price in November 2024 rose 4.7 percent from one year prior to $406,100, which represents the 17th straight month of year-over-year price hikes. Meanwhile, the [average mortgage rate](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/analysis/) for the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate loan stood at 6.91 percent as of December 18, 2024, below its 2024 peak of 7.39 percent in May but still uncomfortably high for many.\\n\\nWhere does that leave housing market trends heading into the first quarter of the new year? Will the numbers improve over the next three months for homebuyers or sellers? And how should they proceed in the short term? Here’s what the industry experts have to say. \\nContent: 79 2023 MORTGAGE MARKET ACTIVITY AND TRENDS  \\n APPENDIX  \\nTABLE A1:  DATA UNDERLYING FIGURE 1  \\nYear/ Month  Median \\nInterest Rate  Year/ Month \\n(cont.)

Fewer people buy and sell homes in the winter months, leading to a decline in home loan applications.\\n\\nFurthermore, mortgage rates have reached their highest levels in weeks. Following the Federal Reserve\\'s [third interest rate cut](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/banking/stubborn-inflation-jeopardizes-additional-fed-rate-cuts-for-2025/) at its December policy meeting, the average [30-year fixed rate](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/) jumped back up to its November high of around 7%.\\n\\nThough the Fed influences the direction of overall borrowing rates, it [doesn\\'t directly control the mortgage market](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/how-the-federal-reserves-decisions-impact-mortgage-rates/). Mortgage rates are driven by investor expectations and move with the yield on the 10-year Treasury, with numerous factors affecting the bond market. For mortgage rates to reverse their upward trend, bond market investors would have to be convinced that the economy is cooling.\\n\\nUntil there\\'s proof that inflation is easing and the job market is softening, [mortgage rates](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-interest-rates-today/) will stay elevated in the near term. The Fed is projecting a slower pace of rate cuts [over the course of 2025](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgage-rates-and-trump-what-homebuyers-can-expect-in-2025/), which will likely keep average rates somewhat volatile, fluctuating between 5.75% on the low end and 7.25% on the high end, according to [HousingWire\\'s 2025

But that may not be enough, Kawashima said. The company’s in talks about when to get the remaining 50% capacity online.\\n\\n“Our customers have concerns,” he said in an interview. “We’re already being asked about our next investment and the next capacity expansion.”\\n\\nIbiden’s shares rose as much as 5.5% in Tokyo on Monday, their biggest intraday gain in more than a month.\\n\\nIbiden’s clients include Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., as well as Nvidia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Many of them consult with the Japanese company early in product development, because the substrates — which help transmit signals from semiconductors to the circuit board — need to be tailored for each chip. Substrates must be made to withstand the heat of an Nvidia graphics processing unit to form an AI chip package complete with components such as memory.\\n\\nFounded as a power utility company in 1912, Ibiden developed semiconductor expertise through a partnership with Intel that Kawashima cultivated by waiting every day in front of the Santa Clara company to stop engineers and executives for product feedback in the early 1990s. At one point, Intel comprised around 70% to 80% of Ibiden’s revenue from chip package substrates. That fell to around 30% in the fiscal year ended March as the US chipmaker struggled to execute a turnaround that recently saw the ousting of CEO Pat Gelsinger.\\n\\nReliance on Intel has hurt Ibiden’s stock, down around 40% this year. In October, Ibiden revised down its profit outlook after sluggish demand for components used in general purpose servers outweighed AI server-related growth. But while noting it was important to expand business with chipmakers other than Intel, Kawashima said he was confident Intel will bounce back.\\n\\nStory Continues\\n\\n“Intel’s overall technology is very sophisticated,” the 61-year-old said. “Intel raised us up and opened so many doors. Our relationship with Intel will always be our treasure, and Intel will forever be an important customer.”\\n\\nWith many foreign chipmakers unwilling to transfer their latest technology to the US, Intel is likely to play a key role in Washington’s goal to boost cutting-edge semiconductor production capabilities at home, Kawashima said. Ibiden itself has no manufacturing facilities in the US. It has no plans to build any due to the cost of labor and logistics, Kawashima said, irrespective of US president-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on a wide range of products.\\n\\nAll of Nvidia’s AI semiconductors now use Ibiden’s substrates, although Taiwanese rivals such as Unimicron Technology Corp. are eyeing the field. But it won’t be easy to break Ibiden’s position as dominant supplier, according to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda.\\n\\n“Nvidia’s AI chips need sophisticated substrates, and Ibiden is the only one that can mass produce them at a good production yield,” he said. “Taiwanese competitors won’t be able to take Ibiden’s share away by much.”\\n\\nAI semiconductors earn more than 15% of Ibiden’s sales of around ¥370 billion ($2.3 billion), with that percentage expected to rise further. Nvidia’s said it’s begun full production of its next-generation Blackwell chips after encountering some initial technical challenges.\\n\\nRead: Nvidia Partner Hon Hai Boosts Capacity to Meet ‘Crazy’ AI Demand\\n\\nOver the long term, Nvidia may face growing competition from application-specific chips by Marvell Technology Inc. and Broadcom Inc. as well as in-house silicon from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. In theory, Ibiden should be able to accommodate them all, as AI chip package design and material will likely remain similar to Nvidia’s, according to Kawashima.\\n\\n(Adds share price movement in the 5th paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\n- [How Elon Musk Took Over America](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-24/podcast-the-year-of-elon-how-elon-musk-took-over-america?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\\n\\n- [Phil Knight Is Using His Nike Fortune to Make Oregon a Football Powerhouse](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-12-20/oregon-ducks-football-phil-knight-nil-donations-built-championship-contender?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\\n\\n- [Two Things Bluesky Needs to Become the Ultimate Sports Companion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-23/bluesky-can-be-a-solid-social-media-site-for-sports-lovers?utm_campaign=bw&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\\n\\n\\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\\n\\nView Comments (4)\\n\\n[Terms](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\\n\\n[Privacy Dashboard](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n- [![TheStreet](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RO6M7dCx66XiY4IQt9d9gA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTE0NDtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-01/843fa1d0-c429-11ee-9ffc-fcd336cb7829)](https://www.thestreet.com/ \"TheStreet\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst revisits AMD stock price target following 2024 slump\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartin Baccardax\\n\\n\\n\\nMon, December 30, 2024 at 7:47 AM CST3 min read\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n    '}]\n",

Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. weighed on the index. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1%.\\n\\nTreasuries rallied, with the 10-year yield hovering around 4.55%. Yields had declined further after Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Index data showed an unexpected decline. Data on Monday also showed pending sales of US homes increasing for a fourth month in November to the highest level since early 2023. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is on track for its best year since 2015.\\n\\nThis year, the so-called Magnificent Seven cohort of US tech giants has driven a 25% advance in the S&P 500, while prompting some to worry that the gains are too concentrated in a small group of names. Still, few are calling for the rally to end and none of the 19 strategists tracked by Bloomberg expects the S&P 500 to decline next year.\\n\\n“In these moments, it’s best to stay put,” said Nicolas Domont, a fund manager at Optigestion in Paris. “The US remains the place to be. Growth stocks continue to outperform and earnings forecasts are good, so there are good reasons to remain optimistic.”\\n\\nElsewhere, Europe’s Stoxx 600 index retreated, while Asian stocks snapped five days of gains. Trading volumes were thinner because of the holiday season.\\n\\n“There’s a little bit of trepidation heading into year-end, owing in part to uncertainty over how the international trade picture may take shape in 2025,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at Kohle Capital Markets Pty. “Some traders are taking risk off the table heading into year-end.”\\n\\nIt’s the final session of 2024 for some markets including Germany, where the DAX benchmark saw a 19% annual advance.\\n\\nOil edged higher as traders focused on 2025 risks. Crude is heading for a loss this year, with trading confined to a narrow range since mid-October. Gold is set for one of its best years.\\n\\nJimmy Carter, the 39th president of the US, died Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. The US stock market has traditionally closed on the day of presidential funerals. The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc.’s US equities exchanges and Cboe Global Markets Inc. will close Jan. 9, in observance of a national day of mourning for Carter.\\n\\nCME Group Inc., operator of US-based equity and interest-rates markets, had not yet commented on its plans. The bond market will close at 2 p.m. New York time, per the recommendation of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.\\n\\nStory Continues\\n\\nCME Group said its equities derivatives market will start trading as usual at 6 p.m. in New York on Jan. 8 and close at 9:30 a.m. the following morning.

      "\n",
      "To maintain [maximum employment](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/what-todays-jobs-report-means-for-mortgage-rates-and-the-fed/) and contain inflation, the Fed assesses economic data to determine whether to raise or lower its benchmark short-term interest rate.

[Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/media/53846/display \"(opens in a new window)\") now expects average [30-year fixed mortgage rates](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/) to hold above 6.5% until early 2025.\n",

      "\n",
      "Aside from the normal day-to-day volatility, mortgage rates will stay above 6% for a while. That may seem high compared with the recent [2% rates](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/still-chasing-2-mortgage-rates-heres-why-its-time-to-let-them-go/) of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a 30-year fixed mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a [30-year fixed mortgage](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/) has been around 7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given a new administration, changes in the geopolitical outlook and a risk of inflation rebounding, forecasts could change again over the coming months. Future rate movement depends on an array of factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trump's economic policies:** Trump's [proposals for tax cuts and tariffs](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/the-truth-about-trumps-housing-proposals-insights-from-a-realtor/) are a big wild card for mortgage rates. Experts say such moves could stimulate demand, increase deficits and push inflation back up. That could prompt the Fed to delay future rate reductions, which in turn would keep home loan rates high.\n",
      "\n",
      "**10-year Treasury yields:** Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates closely track bond yields, specifically 10-year Treasury yields. If inflation and labor data continues to be strong, bond yields and mortgage rates will go up. The opposite will happen if unemployment rises or inflation cools and the Fed continues cutting rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Geopolitical situations:** Mortgage rates are also impacted by geopolitical events, including military conflicts and elections. Political instability can lead to economic uncertainty, which can result in more volatility with bond yields and mortgage rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential curveballs:** Bond investors often act in anticipation of what they believe will happen in the economy. For example, if the expectation is for unemployment to increase, bond yields and mortgage rates will fall. But if the outcome doesn't match market expectations, yields can quickly swing higher or lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other unknowns:** Though Trump's policies have led to expectations of higher inflation and budget deficits, there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the timing and substance of economic changes. Campaign promises rarely mirror the policies that end up being implemented, and it's impossible for investors to predict how big the gap between the two will be.\n",

      "\n",
      "**🏠 Low housing inventory**: A balanced housing market typically has five to six months of supply. Most markets today average around half that amount. Although we saw a surge in new construction in 2022, according to [Zillow](https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-06-18-The-U-S-is-now-short-4-5-million-homes-as-the-housing-deficit-grows \"(opens in a new window)\"), we still have a shortage of around 4.5 million homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**🏠 Elevated mortgage** **rates**: At the start of 2022, mortgage rates were near historic lows of around 3%. As inflation surged and the Fed began hiking interest rates to tame it, mortgage rates roughly doubled within a year. In 2024, mortgage rates are still high, effectively pricing millions of prospective buyers out of the housing market. That's [caused home sales to slow](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/home-sales-are-slow-does-this-mean-housing-prices-will-go-down/), even during typically busy home-buying months, like the spring and early summer.\n",

      "**🏠 Rate-lock effect**: Since the majority of homeowners are [locked into mortgage rates](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-rates-spring-homebuying-season/) below 6%, with some as low as 2% and 3%, they're reluctant to sell their current homes since it would mean buying a new home with a significantly higher mortgage rate.

Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home:\n",
      "\n",
      "**💰 Build your credit score**. Your credit score is one of the main factors lenders consider when determining whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. Working toward a [credit score](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-does-your-credit-score-affect-your-mortgage-rate/) of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**💰 Save for a bigger down payment**. A larger [down payment](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-much-of-a-down-payment-do-you-need-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage/) will allow you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, making a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**💰 Shop around for mortgage lenders**. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you [negotiate a better rate](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-to-negotiate-mortgage-rates/). Experts recommend you get at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders before making a decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "**💰 Consider the rent vs. buy equation**. Choosing to [rent or buy a home](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/should-you-rent-or-buy-a-home/) isn't just comparing monthly rent to a mortgage payment. Renting offers flexibility and lower upfront costs, but buying allows you to build wealth and have more control over your housing costs. The best choice depends on your finances, lifestyle and how long you plan to stay in one place.\n",
      "\n",
      "**💰 Consider mortgage points**.

Tobin said that over the next six months, mortgage rates are expected to decline steeply. According to Freddie Mac, mortgage rates are closer to 6.5% than they are to 7%. Moreover, as consumer demand is expected to increase in the spring season, the outlook for housing ahead of 2024, especially over the first six months seems to be positive. Over the past few months, mortgage rates have declined by one full percentage point. Other important catalysts expected to shape the housing outlook include the vast builder incentives, including price cuts and the expected drop in mortgage rates to lower than 6%.\n",

      "PubMatic's claim to fame is that it's focused entirely on digital advertising. Its cloud-based programmatic ad platform helps publishing companies sell their digital display space, with a focus on video, mobile, and connected TV. Since economic expansions in the U.S. last disproportionately longer than recessions, ad-driven businesses like PubMatic are on the right side of history.\n",

While relying on a third-party provider would have been the easy choice, developing its own platform will result in PubMatic hanging on to more of its revenue as it scales. In other words, this should lead to a superior operating margin over time.\n",

What's more, it's valued at 18 times forward-year earnings while capable of sustained double-digit EPS growth. to vector\n",

Instead, work with what you can afford now, rather than what you might be able to afford later. “Some buyers might have to accept a smaller floor plan or a less perfect home than what they might have been willing to accept \\\\[before\\\\].” In addition, he adds, it pays to know your own local market conditions: “There will be price differentials within markets, and from region to region, which could provide a path toward success for otherwise frustrated aspiring homebuyers.”\\n\\nEvangelou agrees: “Waiting is unlikely to result in better opportunities, as I don’t foresee any significant drops in mortgage rates in the first three months of the year,” she says.\\n\\nSellers, on the other hand, should follow tried-and-true home-sale tactics:\\n\\n- **Price competitively:** Carefully evaluate [local comps](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-to-find-real-estate-comps/) when choosing your list price. “Ensure that previous home sales — including price per square foot — used in setting your listing price are comparable to your home,” says Rossi.\\n- **Keep things neat and tidy:** With prices and rates both high, buyers are less likely to want to take on a project that would require even more money once they buy it. “Make sure your home is presentable to prospective buyers,” Rossi says. The more turnkey the property is, the more likely it is to sell quickly and for full price.\\n- **Don’t get cocky:**“While you should expect the market to still be to your advantage, don’t expect it to be the feeding frenzy of the last few years,” Rossi says. “Patience will be an asset for sellers in higher price tiers.”\\n\\n![](https://navi.cohesionapps.com/display?write_key=wk_2M3TlVcWbz8i1RTZjLkSmbWfyQC&adId=94ae81dee8&req=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Freal-estate%2Fhousing-trends%2F&ref=)\\n\\nEdit Icon\\nCite us\\n\\n\\n**Quick citation guide**\\nSelect a citation to automatically copy to clipboard.\\n\\n\\n**APA:**\\nMartin, E.J.

As with the previous quarters, in Q3 2024, consumption spending led the growth and at 3.7%, grew at the fastest pace since Q1 2023. Consumption spending has remained resilient even in the face of high inflation and a still-high interest rate environment. The contribution of this component to overall growth was around 2.5 percentage points. Compared to Q2 2024, the decrease in Q3 GDP growth was primarily due to a downturn in private inventory investment and a significant deceleration in residential fixed investment. This was partially offset by increases in exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending.\\n\\nThe labor market continued to moderate. Per the latest employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), payroll growth for October witnessed a sharp decline, with the economy adding only 12,000 jobs. However, this slowdown was mainly attributed to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit the Southeastern part of the country, and a strike at Boeing that subtracted around 44,000 jobs from the manufacturing sector. Despite facing temporary disruptions in job growth, the unemployment rate stayed consistent at 4.1% for the second month. Average hourly wage growth also remained at 4% on a year-over-year basis. While the payroll gains for October came in at the lowest level since December 2020, these declines led by temporary events are not a major cause for concern.\\n\\nAs measured by the Employment Cost Index, compensation costs for civilian workers, increased 3.9% in Q3 2024. This is a decrease from the second quarters’ increase of 4.1% and is the lowest since late 2021. This decrease further shows wage growth moderating amid a softening labor market.\\n\\nInflationary pressures have been receding over the past few months, but remain above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.2% over the month in August and 2.7% from a year ago. Prices for goods have been leading the slowdown in overall inflation with a 0.1% monthly decline and a 1.2% yearly decline in September. Conversely, prices for services continue to rise and were up 0.3% month-over-month and rose 3.7% from a year ago.\\n\\nEconomic growth for Q3 2024 remained strong and above the long run trend growth estimate. With the labor market continuing to moderate and inflation cooling towards the Fed target of 2%, and the Federal Reserve might continue on its implied rate cut path.\\n\\n**U.S. housing and mortgage market:**\\xa0Home sales remained subdued despite mortgage rates declining and hitting 2-year lows in September. Total (new + existing) home sales fell 0.2% in September as homebuyers wait for rates to decrease. Existing home sales continued their downward trend with sales in September at the lowest level since October 2010 at 3.84 million. Existing sales continue to reel under the pressure of high mortgage rates and the rate lock-in effect. New home sales rose slightly to 738,000 in September, with the pace of new home sales continuing to run above the pre-pandemic average. In the face of increasing mortgage rates, more builders are using sales incentives and therefore making new homes more attractive for potential buyers. Slower sales have led to a slight pick-up in inventory, with the supply of existing homes at 4.3 months in September, the highest since October 2020. However, despite the recent increase, months’ supply remains low by historical standards and is below the 5 to 6 months’ supply that is typically considered consistent with a balanced housing market.\\n\\nHousing construction also decelerated in September. Total housing starts declined 0.5% from August and 0.7% from last September. This decrease was primarily due to a slowdown in multifamily construction, which decreased over 15% from last September. Homebuilder confidence inched up for the second consecutive month to 43, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index. Though increasing for the second time in six months, the index has remained below 50 since August 2023, indicating that building conditions are expected to remain poor in the near term.2\\n\\nHouse price appreciation continued to slow from the highs witnessed in 2022. As measured by the FHFA House Price Index, U.S. house prices in August 2024 rose 0.3% month over month and 4.2% from last year. All nine census divisions showed annual increases, ranging from 2.4% in the West South Central division to 6.3% in the East North Central division.\\n\\nHigher mortgage rates and low affordability impacted the homeownership rate in Q3 2024. The homeownership rate was slightly lower at 65.6% in Q3 2024 compared to 66% in Q3 2023, per the Residential Vacancies and Homeownership Report by the U.S. Census Bureau. Between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, the total number of housing units rose from 145.4 million to 147.0 million, an increase of around 1.5 million units. Occupied units increased by 1.7 million, while vacant units fell by 0.2 million. Most notably, the increase in occupied housing units was primarily driven by renter-occupied units which increased by 1.1 million units from 44.3 million in Q3 2023 to 45.5 million in Q3 2024. However, owner-occupied units increased only 0.6 million units from 86.0 million to 86.6 million. The homeowner vacancy rate ticked slightly up from 0.9% in Q2 2024 to 1.0% in Q3 2024 and was up from 0.8% in Q3 2023. The renter vacancy rate at 6.9% in Q3 2024 increased from 6.6% in Q2 2024 and from the 6.6% a year ago. The increase in rental vacancy reflects a large backlog of recently completed multifamily construction projects, boosting the number of units available.\\n\\nMortgage rates rose from their two-year low, seen in September at 6.08% and reached 6.72% as of the last week of October. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage as measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey® averaged 6.43% in October. While homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines for mortgage rates to go down, especially after the 50-basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, most of the declines in rates were already baked in by the first Fed rate cut.\\n\\n**Exhibit 1** outlines the change in mortgage rates in the 12 weeks prior and the 12 weeks after the first Fed rate cut in seven episodes since the 1990s. As can be seen from the chart, rates begin declining in anticipation of the Fed rate cut but after the cut, rates remain stable and decline only very gradually. While the Fed usually cuts rates during times of economic distress, this time is different. The U.S. economy remains in a position of strength. Since the first Fed rate cut in September, mortgage interest rates are up nearly ¾ of a percentage point, which is more than average and speaks to the unique circumstances in the economy today.\\n\\nRising rates are unwelcome news to potential homebuyers who might have been hoping that Fed rate cuts would result in lower mortgage rates. However, if we look back historically at past rate cutting cycles, we see that interest rates typically do not fall much following a rate cut. If we look at the previous 6 rate cutting cycles, 6 weeks after the initial Fed rate cut mortgage rates _increased_ on average 0.1 percentage points. This is because mortgage rates are influenced by the long-term rates, which already priced in the Fed rate cut. With economic growth surprising on the upside, bond market participants are starting to consider a slower pace of future rate cuts and factor in the potential for higher-than-expected inflation in the near-term. This has resulted in upward pressure on long-term rates, including mortgage rates.\\n\\n![Line chart showing the change in mortgage rates in the 12 weeks prior and 12 weeks after the first Fed rate cut in seven episodes since the 1990s.

Despite adding 5.8 million housing units over approximately four years (since our previous estimate), housing demand has increased by almost the same amount, resulting in very little progress in reducing the housing shortage. In the aggregate, we estimate that U.S. housing stock is 3.7 million units below what is needed given our current population and assuming inflation-adjusted housing costs returned to historical levels. Even without the push from latent housing demand, the current housing stock remains below levels consistent with historical vacancy rates.\\n\\nWhile there is reason to be optimistic about the housing market given the demographic tailwind and the cohort of Millennials and young adults entering the housing market, high mortgage rates have put a damper on affordability. Rising home prices have also had an effect and are directly related to the supply shortage. Building more houses is essential but builders are also contending with high interest rates.\\n\\nThere is no silver bullet to alleviating this ongoing shortage. That said, there are viable options being considered and acted, upon including accessory dwelling units (ADUs), Community Land Trusts, condominium conversions, manufactured homes, to name a few. We will continue to study this topic and work with the industry to uncover potential solutions.\\n\\n- Footnotes\\n\\n\\n1. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)\\n2.

Our previous analysis assumed a target vacancy rate of 13% which was the average vacancy rate during the period between 1990Q1 and 2018Q2. The target vacancy rate assumed units held off market would continue to remain high as was the trend at that time. However, since our last estimate of the housing shortage in May 2021, housing market conditions have changed and the units off market have been declining especially since 2022. Therefore, we revised our target vacancy rate assumption to correspond to the stable period in the housing market.\\n\\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\\n\\nSam Khater, Chief Economist\\n\\nLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief Economist\\n\\nAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics Manager\\n\\nRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics Manager\\n\\nPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\\n\\nGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\\n\\nCaroline Cheatham, Finance Analyst\\n\\n[www.freddiemac.com/research](https://www.freddiemac.com/research)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

As with the previous quarters, in Q3 2024, consumption spending led the growth and at 3.7%, grew at the fastest pace since Q1 2023. Consumption spending has remained resilient even in the face of high inflation and a still-high interest rate environment. The contribution of this component to overall growth was around 2.5 percentage points. Compared to Q2 2024, the decrease in Q3 GDP growth was primarily due to a downturn in private inventory investment and a significant deceleration in residential fixed investment. This was partially offset by increases in exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending.\\n\\nThe labor market continued to moderate. Per the latest employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), payroll growth for October witnessed a sharp decline, with the economy adding only 12,000 jobs. However, this slowdown was mainly attributed to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit the Southeastern part of the country, and a strike at Boeing that subtracted around 44,000 jobs from the manufacturing sector. Despite facing temporary disruptions in job growth, the unemployment rate stayed consistent at 4.1% for the second month. Average hourly wage growth also remained at 4% on a year-over-year basis. While the payroll gains for October came in at the lowest level since December 2020, these declines led by temporary events are not a major cause for concern.\\n\\nAs measured by the Employment Cost Index, compensation costs for civilian workers, increased 3.9% in Q3 2024. This is a decrease from the second quarters’ increase of 4.1% and is the lowest since late 2021. This decrease further shows wage growth moderating amid a softening labor market.\\n\\nInflationary pressures have been receding over the past few months, but remain above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.2% over the month in August and 2.7% from a year ago. Prices for goods have been leading the slowdown in overall inflation with a 0.1% monthly decline and a 1.2% yearly decline in September. Conversely, prices for services continue to rise and were up 0.3% month-over-month and rose 3.7% from a year ago.\\n\\nEconomic growth for Q3 2024 remained strong and above the long run trend growth estimate. With the labor market continuing to moderate and inflation cooling towards the Fed target of 2%, and the Federal Reserve might continue on its implied rate cut path.\\n\\n**U.S. housing and mortgage market:**\\xa0Home sales remained subdued despite mortgage rates declining and hitting 2-year lows in September. Total (new + existing) home sales fell 0.2% in September as homebuyers wait for rates to decrease. Existing home sales continued their downward trend with sales in September at the lowest level since October 2010 at 3.84 million. Existing sales continue to reel under the pressure of high mortgage rates and the rate lock-in effect. New home sales rose slightly to 738,000 in September, with the pace of new home sales continuing to run above the pre-pandemic average. In the face of increasing mortgage rates, more builders are using sales incentives and therefore making new homes more attractive for potential buyers. Slower sales have led to a slight pick-up in inventory, with the supply of existing homes at 4.3 months in September, the highest since October 2020. However, despite the recent increase, months’ supply remains low by historical standards and is below the 5 to 6 months’ supply that is typically considered consistent with a balanced housing market.\\n\\nHousing construction also decelerated in September. Total housing starts declined 0.5% from August and 0.7% from last September. This decrease was primarily due to a slowdown in multifamily construction, which decreased over 15% from last September. Homebuilder confidence inched up for the second consecutive month to 43, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index. Though increasing for the second time in six months, the index has remained below 50 since August 2023, indicating that building conditions are expected to remain poor in the near term.2\\n\\nHouse price appreciation continued to slow from the highs witnessed in 2022. As measured by the FHFA House Price Index, U.S. house prices in August 2024 rose 0.3% month over month and 4.2% from last year. All nine census divisions showed annual increases, ranging from 2.4% in the West South Central division to 6.3% in the East North Central division.\\n\\nHigher mortgage rates and low affordability impacted the homeownership rate in Q3 2024. The homeownership rate was slightly lower at 65.6% in Q3 2024 compared to 66% in Q3 2023, per the Residential Vacancies and Homeownership Report by the U.S. Census Bureau. Between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, the total number of housing units rose from 145.4 million to 147.0 million, an increase of around 1.5 million units. Occupied units increased by 1.7 million, while vacant units fell by 0.2 million. Most notably, the increase in occupied housing units was primarily driven by renter-occupied units which increased by 1.1 million units from 44.3 million in Q3 2023 to 45.5 million in Q3 2024. However, owner-occupied units increased only 0.6 million units from 86.0 million to 86.6 million. The homeowner vacancy rate ticked slightly up from 0.9% in Q2 2024 to 1.0% in Q3 2024 and was up from 0.8% in Q3 2023. The renter vacancy rate at 6.9% in Q3 2024 increased from 6.6% in Q2 2024 and from the 6.6% a year ago. The increase in rental vacancy reflects a large backlog of recently completed multifamily construction projects, boosting the number of units available.\\n\\nMortgage rates rose from their two-year low, seen in September at 6.08% and reached 6.72% as of the last week of October. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage as measured by Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey® averaged 6.43% in October. While homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines for mortgage rates to go down, especially after the 50-basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, most of the declines in rates were already baked in by the first Fed rate cut.\\n\\n**Exhibit 1** outlines the change in mortgage rates in the 12 weeks prior and the 12 weeks after the first Fed rate cut in seven episodes since the 1990s. As can be seen from the chart, rates begin declining in anticipation of the Fed rate cut but after the cut, rates remain stable and decline only very gradually. While the Fed usually cuts rates during times of economic distress, this time is different. The U.S. economy remains in a position of strength. Since the first Fed rate cut in September, mortgage interest rates are up nearly ¾ of a percentage point, which is more than average and speaks to the unique circumstances in the economy today.\\n\\nRising rates are unwelcome news to potential homebuyers who might have been hoping that Fed rate cuts would result in lower mortgage rates. However, if we look back historically at past rate cutting cycles, we see that interest rates typically do not fall much following a rate cut. If we look at the previous 6 rate cutting cycles, 6 weeks after the initial Fed rate cut mortgage rates _increased_ on average 0.1 percentage points. This is because mortgage rates are influenced by the long-term rates, which already priced in the Fed rate cut. With economic growth surprising on the upside, bond market participants are starting to consider a slower pace of future rate cuts and factor in the potential for higher-than-expected inflation in the near-term. This has resulted in upward pressure on long-term rates, including mortgage rates.\\n\\n![Line chart showing the change in mortgage rates in the 12 weeks prior and 12 weeks after the first Fed rate cut in seven episodes since the 1990s.

Existing home sales have fallen to 14-year lows. Refinance activity, which witnessed a boomlet in September, is also receding as rates are on the rise again.\\n    '}]\n",

Despite adding 5.8 million housing units over approximately four years (since our previous estimate), housing demand has increased by almost the same amount, resulting in very little progress in reducing the housing shortage. In the aggregate, we estimate that U.S. housing stock is 3.7 million units below what is needed given our current population and assuming inflation-adjusted housing costs returned to historical levels. Even without the push from latent housing demand, the current housing stock remains below levels consistent with historical vacancy rates.\\n\\nWhile there is reason to be optimistic about the housing market given the demographic tailwind and the cohort of Millennials and young adults entering the housing market, high mortgage rates have put a damper on affordability. Rising home prices have also had an effect and are directly related to the supply shortage. Building more houses is essential but builders are also contending with high interest rates.\\n\\nThere is no silver bullet to alleviating this ongoing shortage. That said, there are viable options being considered and acted, upon including accessory dwelling units (ADUs), Community Land Trusts, condominium conversions, manufactured homes, to name a few. We will continue to study this topic and work with the industry to uncover potential solutions.\\n\\n- Footnotes\\n\\n\\n1. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)\\n2.

Our previous analysis assumed a target vacancy rate of 13% which was the average vacancy rate during the period between 1990Q1 and 2018Q2. The target vacancy rate assumed units held off market would continue to remain high as was the trend at that time. However, since our last estimate of the housing shortage in May 2021, housing market conditions have changed and the units off market have been declining especially since 2022. Therefore, we revised our target vacancy rate assumption to correspond to the stable period in the housing market.\\n\\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\\n\\nSam Khater, Chief Economist\\n\\nLen Kiefer, Deputy Chief Economist\\n\\nAjita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics Manager\\n\\nRama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics Manager\\n\\nPenka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\\n\\nGenaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\\n\\nCaroline Cheatham, Finance Analyst\\n\\n[www.freddiemac.com/research](https://www.freddiemac.com/research)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac’s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac’s business prospects or expected results.

      "The mortgage market in 2024 is defined by economic shifts, fluctuating interest rates, technological advancements, and evolving borrower needs. Mortgage brokers and lenders found themselves adapting continuously to maintain competitiveness and relevance amid both enduring and emerging challenges. 2023 had laid the groundwork with high interest rates and inflation. 2024 introduced new dynamics that required brokers to embrace innovative strategies, alternative loan products, and client-centered solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the heart of 2024’s mortgage market was the pursuit of affordability. The combination of persistently high rates and elevated property prices challenged homebuyers and homeowners alike. Even as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy steadied, the residual impacts of inflation left many prospective buyers struggling to balance income constraints with rising housing costs. Mortgage brokers responded with creative solutions to make homeownership accessible for their clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology also played a transformative role in 2024, with mortgage firms increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to enhance efficiency, speed, and accuracy in [underwriting](https://admortgage.com/glossary/underwriting), document management, and customer service. E-closings and digital loan platforms gained traction, helping brokers meet the demand for streamlined, client-friendly experiences.\n",

      "Embedding ## 1\\. 2024 Mortgage Market Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. mortgage market in 2024 was heavily influenced by the broader economic environment, with inflationary pressures, Federal Reserve policies, and consumer sentiment shaping both supply and demand. Inflation, while slightly moderated compared to previous years, continued to impact consumer spending power and affordability in the housing market. Despite inflation showing signs of stabilizing, it remained elevated, causing the Federal Reserve to adopt a cautious approach to rate changes. Throughout 2024, the Federal Reserve maintained a relatively high federal funds rate, aiming to curb inflation without triggering a major economic downturn([1)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm). The federal funds rate averaged around 5.25%–5.5% throughout the year, a level intended to slow economic activity gradually and reduce inflation([2)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm).\n",
      "\n",
      "[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFTCaXx_EGZcw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1735047172634?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jcjs1uIdMofWaLW6mx0BP4Y4HBJvUwqhTat_pgg0CPw)](https://admortgage.com/loyalty-program/?utm_source=li&utm_medium=sm&utm_campaign=loyalty-program)\n",
      "\n",
      "This rate environment had a direct impact on mortgage rates, which remained elevated relative to pre-2022 levels. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate closed the year at approximately 6.8%([3)](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms). Though slightly below the peaks seen in 2023, these rates continued to pressure buyers and limit affordability for many. The effects were particularly felt by first-time homebuyers, whose purchasing power was constrained by both high borrowing costs and ongoing home price appreciation. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Market Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage market performance in 2024 reflected these economic pressures, with total [loan origination](https://admortgage.com/glossary/loan-origination) volumes experiencing a modest decline. According to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), mortgage originations dropped by approximately 8% year-over-year. It was driven primarily by lower refinance activity as borrowers hesitated to exchange their existing low-rate mortgages for new loans at higher rates([4)](https://www.mba.org/). Refinancing made up less than 25% of total mortgage activity for much of the year, a significant decline compared to the peak refinancing demand seen during the low-rate environment of 2020-2021([5)](https://www.mba.org/).\n",
      "\n",
      "The purchase mortgage market remained relatively stable, though affordability concerns limited demand in some regions. Brokers and lenders shifted their strategies to focus on client segments less affected by rate sensitivity, such as high-income earners and investors. The demand for non-traditional financing options, including non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) products, saw growth as borrowers sought alternatives to conventional lending standards([6)](https://www.imfpubs.com/). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Housing Market Landscape\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2024 housing market continued to grapple with limited inventory, contributing to sustained home price appreciation in many regions. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the national median home price increased by 4.2% compared to 2023, with certain regions, particularly in the Sun Belt and Midwest, experiencing above-average growth([7)](https://www.nar.realtor/). This trend reflected ongoing demand from buyers relocating from high-cost urban areas in search of affordability, often driven by the flexibility of remote work([8)](https://www.zillow.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, regional variations in housing demand were prominent. High-demand areas, such as Texas, Florida, and Arizona, continued to see price pressures due to limited housing stock. Some previously high-priced urban markets on the coasts, including San Francisco and New York, experienced price stabilization or slight declines. Buyers moved to more affordable areas([9)](https://admortgage.com/blog/mortgage-market-review-2024/(https:/www.redfin.com/). These regional differences required brokers to tailor their strategies based on local market conditions, focusing on affordability solutions in high-demand areas and capitalizing on price stability in cooling markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the 2024 mortgage market was marked by elevated interest rates, constrained affordability, and regional variability in housing demand. Brokers adapted to these dynamics by diversifying their product offerings and focusing on client segments best positioned to navigate a challenging market. Understanding these economic and market trends will be crucial for mortgage professionals as they prepare to navigate similar challenges in 2025. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## 2\\. Interest Rates and Affordability in 2024 to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Rate Fluctuations and Their Impact on Affordability\n",
      "\n",
      "The mortgage market in 2024 was heavily influenced by interest rate fluctuations, which, though modest, had significant implications for affordability and loan demand. The Federal Reserve maintained a relatively high federal funds rate throughout the year, aiming to stabilize inflation without drastically impacting economic growth([10)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm). As a result, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hovered around 6.8%([11)](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms). While this was a slight improvement from 2023’s highs, it remained well above pre-pandemic levels, making home financing less affordable for many borrowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These elevated rates placed downward pressure on both purchasing power and housing affordability. For example, a buyer with a 6.8% interest rate on a $400,000 mortgage faced monthly principal and interest payments around $2,600, compared to approximately $1,900 if rates were closer to 3.5%, as seen in prior years([12)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). The increased cost of borrowing discouraged some potential homebuyers, particularly first-time buyers, from entering the market, contributing to a softening in loan demand, especially in high-cost regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, periods of temporary rate reductions spurred activity as prospective buyers took advantage of even small dips in mortgage rates to secure more favorable loan terms. Brokers observed an uptick in applications during these brief rate decreases, although overall demand remained relatively muted due to persistent affordability challenges([13)](https://www.mba.org/). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Inflation’s Role in Mortgage Rates and Borrower Concerns\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation continued to play a critical role in shaping mortgage rates in 2024. Although inflation showed signs of moderating, it remained above the Federal Reserve’s target, prompting the central bank to keep rates elevated as a preventive measure against further economic overheating([14)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm). This decision indirectly sustained higher mortgage rates, creating additional obstacles for buyers seeking affordability. High inflation affected not only interest rates but also general living costs, which placed further strain on household budgets and limited the portion of income many households could allocate toward mortgage payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brokers reported that many clients expressed concerns about the high rates, particularly those new to homeownership who lacked familiarity with rate fluctuations. As a result, brokers took a proactive role in educating clients on historical interest rate trends and potential rate trajectories. By providing context, brokers helped clients understand that current rates, while high relative to recent years, were within historical norms. Additionally, brokers emphasized that potential rate cuts could offer refinancing opportunities in the future, helping to manage clients’ long-term expectations([15)](https://www.mba.org/).\n",
      "\n",
      "To further assist clients, brokers often recommended exploring hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which typically offer lower initial rates than traditional fixed-rate loans. Freddie Mac noted a 15% increase in applications for 5/1 ARMs in 2024, as many borrowers opted for this structure to reduce monthly payments during the initial years([16)](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Addressing Buyer Affordability Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "Affordability remained a top concern for buyers throughout 2024, as high home prices and interest rates created a challenging environment. Many borrowers struggled to qualify for mortgages at current rates, particularly in high-cost urban markets. To address these challenges, brokers frequently recommended rate-buydown strategies, where buyers or sellers paid points upfront to lower the [interest rate](https://admortgage.com/glossary/interest-rate). These buydowns allowed borrowers to reduce their monthly payments significantly, improving affordability in the short term. [Rate buydowns](https://admortgage.com/glossary/rate-buydown) became particularly popular among first-time buyers and those with constrained budgets([17)](https://www.nar.realtor/).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to buydowns, many brokers turned to [down payment](https://admortgage.com/glossary/down-payment) assistance programs, especially for buyers in urban and suburban areas with elevated home prices. Federal, state, and local programs provided grants or forgivable loans, allowing eligible buyers to make competitive offers despite affordability constraints. These programs were essential in helping first-time buyers bridge affordability gaps, making homeownership possible even in an environment of high rates and prices([18)](https://www.hud.gov/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some brokers also advocated for temporary buydowns, which provide rate reductions in the initial years of the loan. A popular option was the 2-1 buydown, where the interest rate is reduced by 2% in the first year and 1% in the second year, before resetting to the full rate in the third year. These structured buydowns helped buyers ease into their mortgage payments, providing a period of lower payments to adjust to other financial obligations associated with homeownership([19)](https://www.zillow.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Through these adaptive strategies, brokers played a crucial role in helping buyers manage the affordability challenges posed by 2024’s high-interest rate environment. By utilizing a mix of financial tools, including ARMs, buydowns, and down payment assistance programs, brokers supported clients in optimizing their purchasing power and achieving homeownership, even in a market constrained by high rates and inflation. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## 3\\. Rise of Non-QM and Alternative Loan Products to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Demand for Non-QM Loans\n",
      "\n",
      "The demand for Non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) products rose significantly in 2024 as borrowers with unconventional financial profiles sought alternative solutions. Non-QM products, including bank statement loans, DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loans, and asset-based loans, have become vital options for self-employed individuals, real estate investors, and high-net-worth clients who may not meet the standard documentation requirements for traditional mortgages([20)](https://www.imfpubs.com/). According to a report by Inside Mortgage Finance, [Non-QM loans](https://admortgage.com/glossary/non-qm-loan) accounted for approximately 10% of total mortgage originations in 2024, up from 7% in 2023([21)](https://www.imfpubs.com/). This growth is largely attributed to the flexibility these products offer, allowing borrowers to qualify based on alternative income verification methods, such as business cash flow or asset holdings rather than W-2 income.\n",
      "\n",
      "The popularity of Non-QM products reflects the changing nature of the American workforce. As self-employment and gig economy work continue to grow, more borrowers find themselves outside the traditional income structure, making Non-QM loans an essential resource for mortgage brokers who serve this demographic. Moreover, high-net-worth clients, who may have significant assets but irregular income, also favor these products, given the emphasis on liquidity and investment-backed qualifications rather than traditional credit metrics([22)](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/title-insurance-premium-volume-falls-31-year-over-year). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Non-QM Success Stories\n",
      "\n",
      "Brokers specializing in Non-QM loans have effectively used these products to serve a diverse range of clients, demonstrating the adaptability and advantages of alternative financing. For example, a mortgage brokerage in California reported a 30% increase in clients from self-employed sectors, such as tech consultants and small business owners, who utilized bank statement loans to demonstrate consistent cash flow without relying on tax returns([23)](https://www.redfin.com/news/non-qm-loans-rise-2024). This approach allowed borrowers who were previously unable to secure financing to purchase homes, contributing to the brokerage’s growth and establishing it as a go-to resource for unconventional borrowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another case involved real estate investors in Texas using [DSCR loans](https://admortgage.com/programs/dscr/), which qualify borrowers based on the rental income generated by investment properties rather than personal income. DSCR loans provided a streamlined path for these clients to expand their real estate portfolios without traditional income documentation, helping brokers attract repeat business from investors looking to leverage rental properties for further investments([24)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). The success of these loans in helping high-net-worth clients access capital for real estate transactions underscores their value as flexible tools in a broker’s portfolio. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Opportunities and Challenges with Non-QM Loans\n",
      "\n",
      "While Non-QM loans open new opportunities, they also come with distinct challenges and risks. One significant advantage is the ability of brokers to serve clients who might otherwise be locked out of homeownership due to non-traditional income structures. These loans allow for flexible underwriting standards, which enable brokers to expand their client base by accommodating unique financial situations([25)](https://www.imfpubs.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Non-QM loans often carry higher interest rates than conventional loans to offset the increased risk for lenders. This can be a deterrent for some borrowers, particularly those seeking long-term affordability. Brokers need to communicate clearly about these costs and ensure that clients understand both the benefits and financial implications([26)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight).\n",
      "\n",
      "Regulatory considerations add another layer of complexity. Non-QM loans are not eligible for sale to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which limits secondary market options and keeps these products largely in the private sector. This restriction requires brokers to stay updated on regulatory changes and manage underwriting standards closely, as Non-QM loans are subject to higher scrutiny by both investors and regulators([27)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Underwriting for Non-QM loans can also be time-consuming and complex. Each borrower’s unique financial profile often requires customized assessment, from evaluating self-employed income patterns to analyzing asset-based qualifications. This added complexity necessitates a higher level of diligence and expertise from brokers, who must balance client expectations with the more stringent and individualized underwriting process required for these loans([28)](https://www.mba.org/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, Non-QM products offer a valuable opportunity for brokers to build relationships with a diverse client base and develop specialized knowledge that sets them apart in a competitive market. By successfully leveraging Non-QM loans, brokers can not only serve a broader range of clients but also position themselves as experts in alternative lending solutions. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## 4\\. Technological Advancements in Mortgage Processes to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Digital Transformation in 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "The mortgage industry saw a significant shift toward digital transformation in 2024, with advanced technology reshaping processes and enhancing client interactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) became a crucial part of underwriting, enabling lenders to assess applications faster and more accurately. AI-driven models now evaluate borrower risk with unprecedented precision, which allows brokers to approve qualified clients more quickly and reduce the chances of human error([29)](https://www.mba.org/). Additionally, digital loan origination platforms have streamlined document management, allowing clients to submit necessary documentation via secure online portals. This automation has not only accelerated loan processing but also provided greater convenience for borrowers and brokers alike([30)](https://www.forbes.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "E-closings also gained popularity in 2024, with an estimated 20% increase in usage compared to the previous year([31)](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/title-insurance-premium-volume-falls-31-year-over-year). Through digital closing platforms, borrowers can now review and sign documents electronically, eliminating the need for in-person meetings and allowing for faster transaction finalizations. This shift to e-closings has helped brokers and lenders reduce costs associated with physical document processing and has proven especially valuable for clients in remote areas. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Client Experience Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "The adoption of digital tools in the mortgage industry has significantly enhanced client satisfaction, primarily through faster turnaround times and more transparent processes. AI-powered chatbots, for example, have become widely used in mortgage customer service. They allow clients to get real-time answers to questions, check the status of their loan applications, and access general guidance on the mortgage process([32)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). This has enabled brokers to provide a consistent level of service to a larger client base without compromising on quality or responsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another technology that has boosted client satisfaction is digital verification of assets, income, and employment. Tools like digital asset verification have reduced the time required for document review. This allows brokers to expedite applications for well-qualified clients. These automated verifications not only improve client experiences by simplifying the submission process but also give brokers a competitive advantage by shortening the time from application to closing([33](https://www.imfpubs.com/)). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Case Studies of Tech Adoption\n",
      "\n",
      "Several [mortgage brokers](https://admortgage.com/glossary/mortgage-broker) and [mortgage lenders](https://admortgage.com/) have successfully used technology to improve efficiency and client experiences. For example, a brokerage firm in Texas implemented an AI-powered underwriting system that reduced the average loan approval time by 30%. This enabled the firm to close loans faster than its competitors and increase client retention through timely service([34)](https://www.mba.org/).\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In another case, a California-based lender introduced a fully digital application process that included electronic submission of documents and real-time status updates for clients. This approach not only streamlined operations but also improved transparency for clients, who could track every step of their application. The lender reported a 25% increase in customer satisfaction scores following the implementation of this digital system. This underscores the positive impact of tech-driven solutions on the client experience([35)](https://www.redfin.com/news/technology-in-mortgage-2024/).). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Challenges with Tech Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its many benefits, technology adoption in the mortgage industry presents challenges. One major hurdle is training; brokers and lending staff need to be adequately trained to use new systems effectively, which can be time-intensive and costly. Without proper training, employees may struggle to utilize these platforms to their full potential, diminishing the expected efficiency gains([36)](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/title-insurance-premium-volume-falls-31-year-over-year). to vector\n",

      "Integration with legacy systems also poses a significant challenge. Many brokers rely on traditional software that may not seamlessly integrate with newer digital tools. This can lead to data transfer issues and disrupt workflows. Ensuring compatibility between new and old systems often requires substantial investments in IT and infrastructure([37)](https://www.forbes.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, data security remains a primary concern in tech adoption. As brokers handle sensitive client information, [compliance](https://admortgage.com/glossary/compliance) with data privacy regulations, such as those enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is essential. Brokers must invest in secure systems and implement robust cybersecurity practices to protect client data. These practices add to the overall cost of digital transformation([38)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).\n",

      "Embedding ### Regional Price Variations\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, housing affordability and demand continued to vary widely across U.S. regions. Some areas were experiencing rapid price growth and others were cooling. The Sun Belt, in particular, saw above-average home price increases, with states like Texas, Florida, and Arizona leading the trend. The appeal of warmer climates, lower tax rates, and steady job growth in these regions attracted both businesses and remote workers. This resulted in year-over-year home price increases of over 6% in some areas([39)](https://www.redfin.com/news/us-housing-market-july-2024/). In contrast, traditionally high-cost urban centers such as New York City and San Francisco saw more stable prices. There were slight declines in certain neighborhoods as demand softened([40)](https://www.zillow.com/research/housing-market-outlook-2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Midwest also experienced notable growth in housing prices. Cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana, attracted buyers seeking affordable alternatives to coastal cities. These areas offered relatively lower costs of living. This factor became increasingly appealing as buyers adjusted to the impact of elevated mortgage rates([41)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics). Affordability remained a significant factor influencing demand. Buyers gravitated toward regions that allowed them to purchase despite high interest rates. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Migration Patterns and Housing Supply\n",
      "\n",
      "Migration trends in 2024 underscored the ongoing shift from high-density urban areas to more spacious suburban and rural communities. States like Idaho, Tennessee, and South Carolina experienced population influxes as individuals sought homes in lower-cost, traditionally affordable areas([42)](https://www.uhaul.com/Articles/About/Top-States-People-Moved-To-2024). This migration increased demand in areas that previously had moderate housing markets, driving up prices and reducing available inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, suburban markets around major metro areas also saw heightened demand. Remote and hybrid work models allowed buyers greater flexibility in choosing where to live. Suburbs around cities such as Austin, Nashville, and Denver became hot markets. Inventory shortages contributed to competitive bidding situations and rapid price appreciation([43)](https://www.zillow.com/research/remote-work-housing-demand-2024/). However, housing supply constraints remained an issue across much of the country, with limited new construction compounding the challenges in high-demand areas([44)](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/housing-market-report-2024.html). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Impact on Mortgage Brokers\n",
      "\n",
      "These regional housing trends prompted mortgage brokers to adapt their strategies in response to shifting client needs and market conditions. In high-demand Sun Belt and Midwest markets, brokers reported an increased focus on [adjustable-rate mortgage](https://admortgage.com/glossary/adjustable-rate-mortgage-arm) (ARM) products. It offered clients lower initial monthly payments and a feasible path to homeownership despite higher home prices([45)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). Additionally, brokers in these regions adjusted their loan offerings to meet the needs of first-time homebuyers and remote workers. Brokers provided educational resources on market conditions and explored alternative lending products for clients needing flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "For brokers in regions experiencing cooling demand, such as parts of California and New York, there was a renewed emphasis on refinance and home equity products. Home price stabilization offered an opportunity to tap into equity without concerns over fluctuating valuations. That’s why brokers in these areas targeted long-time homeowners looking to leverage their property’s value for other investments([46)](https://www.mba.org/2024-forecast).\n",

      "Embedding ### Limited Housing Inventory and Intense Competition\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout 2024, mortgage brokers faced the significant challenge of limited housing inventory and intense competition among buyers. National housing supply remained constrained, with a shortage of available homes driving prices up and intensifying bidding wars. This limited supply created hurdles for many clients, particularly first-time homebuyers with limited resources to compete in highly competitive markets([47)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics). In response, brokers turned to creative financing solutions, including adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and temporary rate buydowns. That allowed clients to present more competitive offers. Brokers also suggested bridge loans to enable clients to make offers without contingencies on existing home sales([48)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Regulatory Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, significant regulatory changes reshaped the mortgage industry. New lending guidelines forced brokers to revise processes. Meanwhile, consumer protection updates led to further operational adjustments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) introduced stricter transparency requirements in response to concerns about borrower protections, especially for Non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) loans([49)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). These changes demanded that brokers ensure enhanced disclosures around loan terms and repayment conditions. Furthermore, new fair lending guidelines mandated additional documentation to prove compliance with anti-discrimination laws. It increased the administrative burden on brokers but also fostered more responsible lending practices([50)](https://www.mba.org/advocacy-and-policy).\n",
      "\n",
      "To stay compliant, many brokers invested in compliance training programs and digital tools that streamlined documentation and regulatory reporting. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Client Education and Managing Expectations\n",
      "\n",
      "The volatile market of 2024 presented unique challenges for brokers in managing client expectations and educating them. With elevated interest rates and limited housing options, many clients had affordability concerns. Clients also were uncertain about the types of mortgage products that might best meet their needs. Brokers found themselves spending more time educating clients on the pros and cons of various mortgage options. This included the benefits and risks of ARMs and interest-only loans([51)](https://www.zillow.com/research/mortgage-education-tools-2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these concerns, brokers often held informational webinars and one-on-one consultations. It helped clients understand the nuances of different loan types and how market conditions affected affordability. Managing expectations around monthly payments and potential refinancing opportunities also became a key focus. Brokers sought to provide clients with a long-term view of their financing choices. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Economic Volatility\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic volatility in 2024, including inflationary pressures and employment concerns, added further complexity for brokers. Inflation persisted at a high rate, causing living expenses to rise and limiting disposable income available for mortgage payments([52)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/economic-volatility-report-2024). Additionally, concerns over job stability in certain sectors made some clients hesitant to commit to long-term mortgages. Brokers adapted by offering financial planning advice and encouraging clients to build emergency savings. It added reassurance for those uncertain about their financial future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This economic uncertainty led many brokers to focus on adaptable loan products, such as hybrid ARMs. They offered lower introductory rates. Such approach allowed clients to begin with manageable payments while providing flexibility to refinance should rates decrease in the future([53)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). to vector\n",

      "Embedding ### Innovative Mortgage Solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "To support affordability in a high-rate environment, brokers successfully introduced a variety of innovative mortgage solutions. These include hybrid ARMs and interest-only loans. Hybrid ARMs, which feature a fixed rate for an initial period followed by adjustments, gained popularity as clients sought lower monthly payments([54)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). Interest-only loans, which defer principal payments for a set time, also provided flexibility for clients prioritizing cash flow. These products enabled brokers to offer options that aligned with clients’ unique financial situations([55)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Broker Collaboration Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional networks, joint ventures, and referral systems proved instrumental for brokers navigating a competitive and dynamic market. Brokers leveraged these networks to share resources, client leads, and insights. This allowed them to better meet client demands and create resilience within their businesses. Collaborating with real estate agents, financial advisors, and industry experts provided brokers with a steady stream of referrals. Moreover, it positioned them as knowledgeable resources([56)](https://www.mba.org/research-and-forecasts/2024-mortgage-market-insights).\n",
      "\n",
      "This allowed brokers to tap into niche markets, such as high-net-worth individuals or self-employed borrowers, by partnering with specialists in these areas. The collaborative relationships fostered new business opportunities and helped mitigate the impact of market volatility. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Tech-Driven Customer Experiences\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, technology played a key role in enhancing the mortgage customer experience. Brokers were increasingly implementing tools like AI chatbots, client portals, and digital application processes. AI chatbots allowed brokers to provide 24/7 customer support, answer common questions, and offer guidance throughout the application process[57](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight). Client portals enabled borrowers to submit documents, check loan status, and receive updates in real time. This helped improve transparency and reduce the time spent on administrative tasks([58)](https://www.forbes.com/digital-mortgage-technology).\n",
      "\n",
      "Online mortgage applications also streamlined the process, allowing clients to complete applications at their own pace and from any location. This digital accessibility was particularly beneficial for clients in remote or rural areas, where in-person visits were less feasible. Brokers who embraced these technologies reported higher client satisfaction and shorter closing times([59)](https://www.mba.org/technology-in-mortgage-2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "By combining innovative mortgage products, collaborative networks, and technology-driven customer experiences, mortgage brokers successfully adapted to the challenges of 2024.

      "Embedding ### Anticipating Future Market Conditions\n",
      "\n",
      "As brokers look to 2025, preparing for possible rate shifts, economic volatility, and regulatory updates will be essential. Although inflation is expected to moderate, rate fluctuations could still impact borrower affordability([60)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/economic-projections-2024). Brokers can help clients navigate these uncertainties by offering education on rate-lock options and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Rate-locks, which secure current rates for a set period, protect clients from potential rate hikes. ARMs provide an affordable solution with lower introductory rates, especially valuable in high-interest-rate environments([61)](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight).\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic uncertainties, including possible employment fluctuations and ongoing inflationary effects, may also shape the mortgage landscape in 2025. By proactively discussing economic trends with clients, brokers can set realistic expectations and emphasize preparedness. Financial planning services (budgeting assistance or loan structuring) can help clients make informed decisions([62)](https://www.mba.org/research-and-forecasts/2025-housing-outlook). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Expanding Non-QM and Alternative Loan Offerings\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) loans have gained momentum, especially for clients with unconventional income sources. 2025 is expected to see continued demand for these products. Brokers can expand their Non-QM offerings by adding more options. These are [bank statement loans](https://admortgage.com/programs/bank_statement/), debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) loans, and asset-based loans. Such products allow borrowers to qualify based on non-traditional financial criteria. They are suitable for self-employed clients, real estate investors, and high-net-worth individuals([63)](https://www.imfpubs.com/2024-non-qm-market-report).\n",
      "\n",
      "Effectively positioning Non-QM products involves educating clients on the benefits and nuances of these loans. For example, Non-QM loans often come with higher rates due to increased risk. However, they also provide flexibility for clients who may not qualify for traditional loans. Case studies and success stories can demonstrate how similar clients have leveraged Non-QM loans to achieve financial goals([64)](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/2024-non-qm-loan-demand). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Adopting Digital Tools for Efficiency and Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital transformation in mortgage lending is essential for brokers seeking competitive advantages in 2025. Integrating digital tools for document management, loan processing, and compliance can help brokers boost productivity and maintain regulatory adherence([65)](https://www.forbes.com/digital-transformation-mortgage-2024/).). By using e-signature platforms, digital verifications, and secure portals for client interactions, brokers can simplify processes. These practices will help reduce time and costs associated with paper-based workflows([66)](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/e-signature-tools-in-mortgage).\n",
      "\n",
      "Compliance tools are also critical, especially given regulatory updates anticipated in 2025. Digital compliance software can track regulatory changes and automate reporting. This way brokers remain compliant with consumer protection rules and data security standards. Implementing these tools reduces compliance risk and helps maintain client trust([67)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/mortgage-industry-compliance-2025). to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Strengthening Client Relationships for Retention and Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "In a competitive and uncertain market, proactive client relationship management is crucial. Transparent communication about loan options, market conditions, and potential rate movements can significantly strengthen client trust. Regular check-ins, such as quarterly calls or annual reviews, provide clients with updates on their mortgage options. These check-ins will show that brokers are committed to their long-term financial success([68)](https://www.mba.org/client-management-best-practices-2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Educating clients about available mortgage products and services helps them feel supported and informed. Brokers can share educational content through newsletters, webinars, and social media, positioning themselves as knowledgeable resources.

      "Embedding ## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "As mortgage brokers look to 2025, the insights and experiences gained from 2024 offer a valuable foundation for future success. The past year has underscored the importance of adaptability, resilience, and a client-focused approach in an ever-evolving market. Elevated interest rates, economic volatility, and regional market shifts have presented challenges. Still, they have also opened opportunities for brokers to innovate, expand their product offerings, and strengthen client relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key takeaways from 2024 is the importance of anticipating market changes. Preparing for potential rate fluctuations and remaining agile amid economic uncertainty allows brokers to provide clients with strategic financing options. Educating clients, helping them understand short- and long-term benefits, fosters trust and positions brokers as knowledgeable partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting on these lessons from 2024, brokers can step confidently into 2025 with strategies that balance innovation and client-centricity. Adapting to market conditions, leveraging digital advancements, and expanding product offerings will enhance competitive positioning. Moreover, it will reinforce brokers’ roles as trusted advisors, helping clients achieve their homeownership goals in any market environment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Home prices are heavily influenced by supply and demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent analysis by Zillow revealed that the U.S. is facing a shortage of 4.5 million homes needed for a healthy housing supply. When there aren’t enough homes to meet demand in a housing market, both home prices and rental costs typically rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Redfin, in October 2024, U.S. home prices increased by 5.0% compared to the previous year, with a median sale price of $434,720. So, despite a sharp drop in demand, there are still more buyers than sellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s not forget about the impact of new home construction. It hasn’t been keeping up with demand. As noted in a Freddie Mac research report, the housing shortage is largely driven by a sustained decrease in the building of single-family homes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "While elevated mortgage rates often slow down price growth or even push prices lower, the ongoing shortage of available housing has counteracted this effect. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Economic factors**\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to record-high inflation in 2022, the Federal Reserve began aggressively increasing the federal funds rate to bring inflation under control. This contributed to a sharp rise in mortgage rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "By October 2024, inflation had slowed considerably, with the consumer price index increasing by just 2.6% year-over-year, a significant drop from its June 2022 peak of 9.1%. As a result of this progress, the Fed has shifted its approach, reducing its benchmark rate by [50 basis points in September](https://themortgagereports.com/114765/fed-rate-cut-september-2024) and another [25 basis points in November.](https://themortgagereports.com/115642/fed-rate-cut-november-2024)\n",
      "\n",
      "While mortgage rates aren’t directly tied to the federal funds rate, they often fluctuate in response to investor expectations about how Fed policies will influence the broader economy. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **The impact of mortgage rates**\n",
      "\n",
      "Although mortgage rates have decreased from their peak of nearly 8% in October 2023, they remain higher than what many homeowners and prospective buyers are accustomed to.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put things in [historical perspective](https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart), from 2010 until 2020, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.09%, according to Freddie Mac data. Then, during the pandemic, rates dropped even lower, reaching an all-time low of 2.65% in January 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023, mortgage rates began rising at a rapid pace. The higher rates have contributed to homebuying demand being relatively low in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgage rates have also impacted home sellers. Many potential sellers have been hesitant to list their properties, unwilling to part with their existing low-rate mortgages. This [“lock-in effect”](https://themortgagereports.com/112809/housing-market-lock-in-effect) constrained housing supply and helped keep prices from falling, even as rates spiked. to vector\n",

      "\n",
      "Mortgage rates are projected to decline in 2025, potentially improving affordability for buyers. This is likely to spark greater demand, however, which could keep home prices elevated or even drive them higher.\n",

      "Redfin forecasts that the median U.S. home sale price will gradually increase throughout 2025, finishing the year 4% higher than in 2024. This projected growth mirrors the trend seen in the latter half of 2024, driven by a persistent imbalance between supply and demand for housing.\n",

      "Mortgage rates are expected to hover around 6.3% in 2025. That’s down over half a percent from the 6.7% average expected by the end of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Redfin’s economists, certain economic conditions—such as the effects of tax cuts and tariffs—could lead the Federal Reserve to make only a few small reductions to its benchmark interest rate. This would likely keep mortgage rates relatively high.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to [2025 mortgage rate predictions](https://themortgagereports.com/116026/2025-mortgage-rate-predictions), there is a chance that rates could fall even lower if the economy slows down or if significant policy changes occur. However, rates could also rise further if inflation accelerates or the government deficit increases. to vector\n",

      "Redfin forecasts that the annual rate of existing home sales will climb to between 4.1 million and 4.4 million in 2025, representing a 2% to 9% increase compared to 2024. However, the exact growth rate depends on several factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "If mortgage rates remain elevated and [inventory stays tight](https://themortgagereports.com/111334/home-listings-surge-november-2024), the rise in sales could be modest. Conversely, if rates decline more than anticipated and the strong buyer demand seen in recent months persists, the increase in sales could be much more significant. to vector\n",

      "\n",
      "And while many prospective buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to decrease before entering the market, this could be a risky strategy. Yes, lower rates will make mortgages more affordable, but it’s important to consider that home prices may rise when interest rates drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, buying now could mean avoiding the increased competition and higher prices that often accompany lower rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you may be able to save money in the future by refinancing your mortgage if rates decline. Some lenders have been offering “buy now, refinance later” programs, making it easier and more affordable for buyers to take advantage of current opportunities despite higher rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consult with a real estate agent to understand the dynamics of your local market. If there are plenty of homes in your price range and minimal competition, now might be an opportunity to grab a good deal.\n",

      "The New Year is upon us, and it couldn’t have come at a better time for many [home shoppers](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-to-buy-a-house/) and real estate players eager to turn the calendar page and say goodbye to 2024’s challenging market — a period when home prices climbed ever higher and mortgage rates swung up, then tantalizingly down, then deflatingly back up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the latest National Association of Realtors (NAR) data, the median [existing-home sales](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/existing-home-sales/) price in November 2024 rose 4.7 percent from one year prior to $406,100, which represents the 17th straight month of year-over-year price hikes. Meanwhile, the [average mortgage rate](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/analysis/) for the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate loan stood at 6.91 percent as of December 18, 2024, below its 2024 peak of 7.39 percent in May but still uncomfortably high for many.\n",

      "Embedding ## Q1 2025 housing market trends: What to expect\n",
      "\n",
      "The first quarter of the year is frequently the slowest for real estate. Only 19 percent of annual sales occur during this time, according to Nadia Evangelou, NAR’s senior economist and director of real estate research, and low inventory persists as buyers and sellers wait out the cold weather. In 2024, though, housing market trends broke from their usual seasonal patterns. Activity dipped over the summer, but pent-up demand fueled a fall rebound. By the year’s final quarter, the market was recovering from its summer slump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This pent-up demand is expected to continue and boost performance in the first quarter of 2025,” Evangelou says. “However, the housing market will also be impacted by the Trump administration’s economic policies during the first 100 days, including proposed tariffs and tax cuts, which could affect [inflation](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/inflation-housing-market/) and government spending. With the specifics still unclear, their full impact remains uncertain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford Rossi, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business and former Chief Risk Officer for Citigroup’s Consumer Lending Group, says the factors that will drive the housing market in the first quarter of 2025 will be mortgage rates, consumer confidence and affordability. “Economic conditions will be a determining factor for how fast and far the [Federal Reserve](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-fed-interest-rate-affects-housing-market/) decides to bring down interest rates,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "With home price growth slowing in many areas and mortgage rates stabilizing, Rossi anticipates the first quarter will trend toward a more typical housing market, but still fall short of a balanced one. “While affordability remains a major concern for the market, the economy is poised to continue to perform well, translating into strong demand for housing,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenon Chen, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Growth for Clear Capital, also expects traditional Q1 patterns to begin 2025. “The main question will be how fast we see acceleration in the first quarter moving toward the [spring buying season](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/best-time-to-sell-house/),” he says. “Mortgage rates have been easing slightly in December, and the recent rate cut at the December Fed meeting could help that along. This would be good news for a positive start to the year, especially for purchase volume.”\n",

      "The pros anticipate home financing trends, and particularly the 30-year mortgage rate, to remain relatively flat in early 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "> We may continue to see mortgage rates moving within the current range, given the outlook for a firm job market and solid growth.\n",
      ">  — Mark Hamrick, Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have recently seen the average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages back below 7 percent but well above the average of 6.20 percent we notched in September,” says Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst. “My sense is that we may continue to see mortgage rates moving within this range, given the outlook for a firm job market and solid growth. That will put a floor beneath the yield of the 10-year Treasury, which correlates to the rate of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen predicts that 30-year mortgage rates will gradually decline over the next quarter and across 2025, ending up in the low 6 percent range. Rossi, meanwhile, envisions an average of 6.25 percent in the first three months of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dennis Shirshikov, an adjunct professor of economics at City University of New York, offers a similar forecast: “Expect a slight rate decrease from 2024 levels — my projection is 6.25 percent average rates for the 30-year fixed and 5.75 percent average rates for the 15-year fixed mortgage,” he says. “This aligns with Federal Reserve signals indicating cautious easing in monetary policy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Fed has indicated that it would likely cut rates two more times in 2025, ongoing concerns about inflation and government spending are expected to keep mortgage rates from dropping significantly during this time, says Evangelou. She predicts that 30-year fixed mortgage rates will average 6.5 percent over the next three months. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Where home prices are heading\n",
      "\n",
      "With strong purchase demand anticipated and the hope that mortgage rates will gradually decline, home prices are likely to keep rising, Chen says. “Appreciation rates should remain in the low single digits in 2025, but overall [home affordability](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/new-house-calculator/) will still be challenging.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Prices will continue to see solid growth in quarter one, with the typical home value projected to average $420,000,” predicts Evangelou. “Even though mortgage rates will not likely see any meaningful change in the first quarter, solid job growth and improving inventory are expected to drive momentum in home sales activity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shirshikov, on the other hand, believes home prices will probably stay flat or rise only modestly due to [chronic inventory shortages](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/low-inventory-housing-shortage/). “Sales in general will slow marginally compared to early 2024, with average days on the market increasing up to 50 days,” he says. “However, homes priced competitively and in desirable locations will still sell quickly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://navi.cohesionapps.com/display?write_key=wk_2M3TlVcWbz8i1RTZjLkSmbWfyQC&adId=d537c83d45&req=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Freal-estate%2Fhousing-trends%2F&ref=) to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Housing inventory predictions for Q1\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing supply has been increasing lately and is anticipated to improve further in the coming months, says Evangelou. The increased supply of homes for sale will be boosted by new construction projects and more homeowners listing their properties, encouraged by stabilizing mortgage rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen agrees — to a point. “Based on this year’s trends, it seems likely that inventory will continue to increase in 2025, but only moderately,” he says. “If mortgage rates end up around 6 percent next year, the majority of existing homeowners will still be experiencing the ‘lock-in’ effect of having a much lower current mortgage rate. This will continue to moderate how many existing homes end up on the market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Supply will not rebound significantly anytime soon, Shirshikov says. “Inventory will likely remain tight due to new construction delays, high construction costs and ‘golden handcuffs’ keeping homeowners with low interest rate mortgages from selling,” he predicts. “Expect a year-over-year drop of about 5 percent to 10 percent in active listings as a result.” to vector\n",

In the near- term, rates may continue to be volatile and higher rates will keep home sales muted for the remainder of this year. But as we get into 2025, we anticipate that rates will gradually decline throughout the year. The expected decline in mortgage rates in 2025 should loosen some of the rate lock-in effect for existing homeowners, offering more inventory in the market. The rate lock-in effect for October increased again as mortgage rates increased — up from $38,000 in September to $42,000 as of October 2024. Lower rates and the boost to inventory should lead to slightly higher home sales in 2025. We expect house prices to continue to grow, although at a slower pace.\n",

      "\n",
      "Housing affordability remains one of the top economic issues facing American households. Both homeowners and renters have seen the cost of housing increase faster than other consumer prices, putting a significant strain on household budgets. As we have documented in several previous research notes,3 the root cause of decreased housing affordability is the fact that housing supply has not increased enough to match demand. Inadequate housing supply leads homeowners and renters to bid up the sale price and rent of available housing, which puts a squeeze on affordability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this spotlight we provide an updated estimate of the housing supply shortage relative to long-run housing demand. In our last published estimate from May of 2021, we estimated that the U.S. housing shortage was 3.8 million units as of Q4 2020. Our updated estimate based on data through Q3 2024 is that the U.S. housing shortage has declined slightly to 3.7 million units.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Exhibit 2** below breaks down how we arrived at the new estimate and compares it to prior estimates. Since our previous estimate for Q4 2020, the U.S. housing stock has increased by 5.8 million units, or an average annual rate of 2.1 million units per year. However, over that same time the number of households increased by 6.3 million (2.3 million annual rate), while target or latent households increased by 6.9 million (2.5 million annual rate). But despite the increases in housing stock and the much larger increase in household formation, our estimate of housing shortage is slightly lower than our previous estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s due to our lower target vacancy rate assumption. Our previous analysis assumed a target vacancy rate of 13% which was the average vacancy rate during the period between Q1 1990 and Q2 2018. The target vacancy rate assumed units held off market would continue to remain high as was the trend at that time. However, since our last estimate, housing market conditions have changed, and the units held off market have been declining, especially since 2022. Therefore, we revised our target vacancy rate assumption to correspond to the stable period in the housing market which we consider was from Q1 1994 - Q4 2003. Thus, our target vacancy rate declined from 13% to 11.7%, reducing the number of vacant housing units needed by 1.3 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Table showing the calculations underlying the U.S. housing shortage estimate as of Q3 2024. Since our Q4 2020 estimate, the household gap increased by 0.6 million to 1.0 million units, the vacant units gap decreased by 0.8 million to 2.7 million units, and the overall housing stock gap decreased by 0.1 million to 3.7 million units. ](/sites/g/files/ynjofi111/files/styles/wide/public/202411-Outlook-November-2024-fc-charts-ex02.jpg?itok=uBQejdfM)\n",

      "\n",
      "The first component in estimating the housing shortage is housing demand. While we can directly observe the actual number of households in any given period, we cannot see households that have not formed due to high housing costs. To estimate the target number of households, we employ a counterfactual analysis. This method allows us to project the number of households that would have formed if housing cost had remained at the level in our benchmark period, which is the year 2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "While household formation increased during the pandemic, limited supply has meant that many potential homebuyers have been priced out due to affordability concerns. To estimate the latent demand, we consider the households that could have been formed were the housing costs more favorable. For our estimate of housing costs, we utilize rent data.4 From 2000 to 2024 inflation-adjusted rents increased by 11%, from $1,396 per month to $1,556 per month. In our counterfactual, we set real rents back at 2000 levels and estimate the number of additional households that would create.\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtain the current headship rates by 5-year population groups starting from 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, etc., from the Current Population Survey–Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) using the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (Flood et al. 2017).5 We then adjust the current headship rate by the housing cost factor to obtain the target headship rate. To obtain the housing cost factor, we run an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition on the factors affecting household formation (including income and education, housing costs, race and age, marriage and children, etc.). We use rents as a proxy for housing costs as rents directly impact household formation. Based on the contribution of these factors, we add back the factors related to housing costs to the current headship rate to get the target headship rate which can be written as:\n",

      "\n",
      "Applying the new headship rates to the 2024 population by these 5-year age groups, we get the target households for each of the age group. If housing costs as measured by rents were more affordable, we estimate that the U.S. would have added 1 million more households with most of the growth coming from younger households. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Vacant units for a well-functioning market\n",
      "\n",
      "The second component in the estimation of the housing shortage is vacant units. A well-functioning housing market requires some vacant properties. If there are too few vacant housing units, home sales and new rentals will be hard to fill as there will be limited options that are move-in ready. In addition, there are some homes that are either seasonally vacant or held off market. Overall vacancy rate was at 10.1% in Q3 2024, 1.6 percentage points below our target vacancy rate of 11.7%, which is derived as described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the estimation of the housing supply shortage, we need a target vacancy rate. As explained above, we assume the vacancy rate during the “stable period” in the housing market (Q1 1994 – Q4 2003), 11.7%, to be the target vacancy rate.6 Within this vacancy, we assume that the seasonally vacant units average 2.8% of the housing stock, 0.7% are assumed to be in the process of being rented or sold, 3.6% for rent or sale, and 4.5% held off market. **Exhibit 3**, on the following page, converts the target vacancy rate to the target number of vacant units needed by type of vacancy.

In our last published estimate from May of 2021, we estimated that the U.S. housing shortage was 3.8 million units as of Q4 2020. Our updated estimate based on data through Q3 2024 is that the U.S. housing shortage has declined slightly to 3.7 million units.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Exhibit 2** below breaks down how we arrived at the new estimate and compares it to prior estimates. Since our previous estimate for Q4 2020, the U.S. housing stock has increased by 5.8 million units, or an average annual rate of 2.1 million units per year. However, over that same time the number of households increased by 6.3 million (2.3 million annual rate), while target or latent households increased by 6.9 million (2.5 million annual rate). But despite the increases in housing stock and the much larger increase in household formation, our estimate of housing shortage is slightly lower than our previous estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s due to our lower target vacancy rate assumption. Our previous analysis assumed a target vacancy rate of 13% which was the average vacancy rate during the period between Q1 1990 and Q2 2018. The target vacancy rate assumed units held off market would continue to remain high as was the trend at that time. However, since our last estimate, housing market conditions have changed, and the units held off market have been declining, especially since 2022. Therefore, we revised our target vacancy rate assumption to correspond to the stable period in the housing market which we consider was from Q1 1994 - Q4 2003. Thus, our target vacancy rate declined from 13% to 11.7%, reducing the number of vacant housing units needed by 1.3 million.\n",

Since our Q4 2020 estimate, the household gap increased by 0.6 million to 1.0 million units, the vacant units gap decreased by 0.8 million to 2.7 million units, and the overall housing stock gap decreased by 0.1 million to 3.7 million units. ](/sites/g/files/ynjofi111/files/styles/wide/public/202411-Outlook-November-2024-fc-charts-ex02.jpg?itok=uBQejdfM)\n",

      "\n",
      "The first component in estimating the housing shortage is housing demand. While we can directly observe the actual number of households in any given period, we cannot see households that have not formed due to high housing costs. To estimate the target number of households, we employ a counterfactual analysis. This method allows us to project the number of households that would have formed if housing cost had remained at the level in our benchmark period, which is the year 2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "While household formation increased during the pandemic, limited supply has meant that many potential homebuyers have been priced out due to affordability concerns. To estimate the latent demand, we consider the households that could have been formed were the housing costs more favorable. For our estimate of housing costs, we utilize rent data.4 From 2000 to 2024 inflation-adjusted rents increased by 11%, from $1,396 per month to $1,556 per month. In our counterfactual, we set real rents back at 2000 levels and estimate the number of additional households that would create.\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtain the current headship rates by 5-year population groups starting from 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, etc., from the Current Population Survey–Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) using the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (Flood et al. 2017).5 We then adjust the current headship rate by the housing cost factor to obtain the target headship rate. To obtain the housing cost factor, we run an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition on the factors affecting household formation (including income and education, housing costs, race and age, marriage and children, etc.). We use rents as a proxy for housing costs as rents directly impact household formation. Based on the contribution of these factors, we add back the factors related to housing costs to the current headship rate to get the target headship rate which can be written as:\n",

      "\n",
      "Applying the new headship rates to the 2024 population by these 5-year age groups, we get the target households for each of the age group. If housing costs as measured by rents were more affordable, we estimate that the U.S. would have added 1 million more households with most of the growth coming from younger households. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Vacant units for a well-functioning market\n",
      "\n",
      "The second component in the estimation of the housing shortage is vacant units. A well-functioning housing market requires some vacant properties. If there are too few vacant housing units, home sales and new rentals will be hard to fill as there will be limited options that are move-in ready. In addition, there are some homes that are either seasonally vacant or held off market. Overall vacancy rate was at 10.1% in Q3 2024, 1.6 percentage points below our target vacancy rate of 11.7%, which is derived as described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the estimation of the housing supply shortage, we need a target vacancy rate. As explained above, we assume the vacancy rate during the “stable period” in the housing market (Q1 1994 – Q4 2003), 11.7%, to be the target vacancy rate.6 Within this vacancy, we assume that the seasonally vacant units average 2.8% of the housing stock, 0.7% are assumed to be in the process of being rented or sold, 3.6% for rent or sale, and 4.5% held off market. **Exhibit 3**, on the following page, converts the target vacancy rate to the target number of vacant units needed by type of vacancy.

      "The 2023 HMDA data are the sixth  year  of data that reflect changes  implemented by  the 2015 \n",
      "HMDA rule . Overall, 202 3 was a year marked by a significant downturn of mortgage lending \n",
      "activities across all major segments. The total number of applications and originations dropped \n",
      "significantly in 2023 with the number of applications decreasing by about 4.3 million or 30.3 \n",
      "percent and originations decreasing by 2.7 million or 32.2 percent. The significant decline occurred in both home purchase and refinance lending  but was mo re prominent in refinanc e, \n",
      "with t he closed -end site -built single -family refinance originations decreasing  by 64.2 percent \n",
      "from a year ago. The decline continued throughout the year. By the end of 202 3, the only  \n",
      "refinance originations left in the market were a small number of cash -out refinance loans.  There \n",
      "was an increase in denial rates year -to-year for both home purchase and refinance applications.  \n",
      "The median total loan costs jumped significantly in 202 3. A higher percentage of borrowers \n",
      "reported having  paid discount points in 2023 than any other year since this  data point was  \n",
      "collected  in the HMDA  data . Furthermore , borrowers who paid discount points also paid  larger  \n",
      "dollar amount s in points. Black and Hispanic w hite borrowers continued to have lower median \n",
      "credit scores and higher denial rates, in addition to paying higher median total loan costs \n",
      "relative  to non -Hispanic white and Asian borrowers.  \n",
      "The average monthly mortgage payment at origination excluding taxes and insurance for \n",
      "borrowers rose s ignificantly in 2023 , driven almost entirely by the rise in mortgage interest \n",
      "rates. Despite  the increase in the  mortgage payment  amount, the average DTI and the share of \n",
      "home purchase applications denied due to high  DTI have not significantly changed  year -over -\n",
      "year. This is likely driven by mortgage lenders requiring higher income s to approve a loan. This  \n",

      "1\\. Present age and remaining working years:\n",
      "\n",
      "The age of the applicant plays a major role in determining [home loan eligibility](/home-loan-eligibility-calculator). With the maximum loan term generally capped at 30 years or the age of retirement, a young person can avail a longer term loan; for the old, the loan term will be comparatively shorter. Further, the longer working life that a young individual will enjoy will enable him/her to enjoy better loan terms vis-à-vis the old.\n",

      "2\\. Financial position:\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that you are able to service the loan regularly, your present and future income will have a significant impact on determining the loan amount. Along with the quantum of income, the stability and quality of income is also considered.\n",

      "5\\. Personal profile:\n",

      "Embedding # Home Loan Balance Transfer or Top-Up Loan: Determining the Better Financial Choice\n",
      "\n",
      "Deciding between a home loan transfer and a top-up loan can greatly affect your finances and future plans. Each option offers distinct advantages depending on your current circumstances and financial goals. To make an informed decision, it’s crucial to understand the differences, benefits, and considerations associated with both home loan balance transfers and top-up loans. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Understanding Home Loan Balance Transfer:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A home loan balance transfer involves transferring your existing home loan to another lender offering lower interest rates or better terms. Borrowers often choose this option to lower their monthly payments, save on interest, or combine multiple loans into one payment. Here are key considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lower Interest Rates:** One of the primary reasons for opting for a balance transfer is to secure a lower interest rate, which can lead to significant savings over the loan tenure.\n",
      "2. **Consolidation of Loans:** If you have multiple loans, consolidating them through a balance transfer can simplify your finances and potentially lower your overall monthly payments.\n",
      "3. **Processing Fees:** While a balance transfer may offer lower interest rates, consider any processing fees or charges associated with transferring your loan to ensure overall savings. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Benefits of Top-Up Loans:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A top-up loan allows existing home loan borrowers to borrow additional funds over and above their current loan amount, leveraging the equity built in their property. Here’s why a top-up loan might be beneficial:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Access to Funds:** If you need additional funds for home renovations, repairs, education expenses, or any other purpose, a top-up loan provides a convenient source of finance without the need for separate borrowing arrangements.\n",
      "2. **Lower Interest Rates:** Top-up loans often come with lower interest rates compared to personal loans or other unsecured borrowing options, making them a cost-effective choice for accessing extra funds.\n",
      "3. **Flexible Repayment Terms:** Borrowers can benefit from flexible repayment options, including extended tenures, which can help manage monthly cash flow more effectively. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Determining the Better Financial Choice:**\n",
      "\n",
      "When deciding between a home loan balance transfer and a top-up loan, consider the following factors: to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### Access to Better Loan Terms\n",
      "\n",
      "When you check your eligibility in advance, you can compare different lenders and loan products to find the best fit for your financial situation. This comparison allows you to identify lenders who offer favourable interest rates, lower processing fees, and flexible repayment options. Being an informed borrower empowers you to negotiate better terms and conditions, ultimately saving you money over the life of the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Current Interest Rates:** Evaluate the interest rates offered by your current lender and potential new lenders through a balance transfer. Calculate potential savings over the remaining loan tenure.\n",
      "2. **Financial Goals:** Determine your immediate financial needs and long-term goals. If you require additional funds for specific purposes, a top-up loan may be more suitable. If your primary goal is to reduce interest costs, a balance transfer could be advantageous.\n",
      "3. **Costs and Fees:** Compare processing fees, prepayment penalties, and other associated costs for both options. Factor in these expenses to determine the overall financial impact of each choice.\n",
      "4. **Credit Profile:** Your credit score and financial history will also play a crucial role in eligibility and interest rates offered by lenders for both balance transfers and top-up loans. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Both home loan balance transfers and top-up loans offer distinct advantages depending on your financial needs and goals. Whether you prioritise reducing interest costs, accessing additional funds, or simplifying your loan structure, carefully evaluate the benefits and considerations of each option. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide further insights and help you make an informed decision that aligns with your financial strategy and objectives.\n",

      "\n",
      "As environmental awareness grows, people are increasingly seeking ways to make more sustainable choices in every aspect of their lives. One of the most impactful choices we can make is in the way we live and, specifically, in the homes we choose to build or buy. Green housing has become a vital solution for creating more environmentally friendly living spaces and achieving long-term sustainability. In this article, we’ll explore the importance of green housing, what makes a home “green,” and how it benefits individuals and communities. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Lower Property Costs?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Under-construction properties are generally priced lower than ready-to-move-in homes. Builders offer competitive rates to attract buyers before construction is complete, which means you get a property with significant potential for value appreciation at a lower cost. By financing this purchase with a home loan, you can secure an asset at an affordable price while spreading payments over time, which keeps your immediate expenses manageable. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Tax Benefits on Home Loans**\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like any other home loan, a loan for an under-construction property provides tax benefits under the Income Tax Act. Borrowers can claim deductions on both principal and interest components once the construction is complete. The interest paid during the pre-construction period can be claimed in five equal installments starting from the year the property’s construction is finished. This adds up to substantial savings over time, especially for those in higher tax brackets. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Appreciation Potential**\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key advantages of buying an under-construction property is the potential for significant price appreciation by the time it’s ready for possession. As the property moves closer to completion, market value often increases. By investing early with a home loan, you are essentially locking in the purchase price at a lower rate. This not only grows your equity but also means that you might have a property worth significantly more than what you paid by the time construction is complete. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Flexible Payment Schedules**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many banks and financial institutions offer flexible payment schedules for under-construction properties. This typically includes a staggered payment approach where payments are released to the builder in phases as construction progresses. This can help you manage your finances effectively and offers an advantage over lump-sum payments, which are often required for ready-to-move properties. With a flexible payment structure, you also have time to build savings as you pay in stages. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Higher Resale Value**\n",
      "\n",
      "Buying an under-construction home provides the opportunity to acquire a newly built property with modern facilities and updated design trends, which are attractive to potential buyers. Properties that are recently constructed often fetch higher prices in the market, as they are seen as newer and better maintained. Should you decide to sell the property later, you may benefit from the resale value, making your investment in an under-construction property a wise financial decision. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **More Options to Choose From**\n",
      "\n",
      "When purchasing a ready-to-move-in home, options can be limited, as you’re choosing from properties that are already available. However, by opting for an under-construction property, you typically have access to more units and choices in terms of layout, floor plans, and location within the complex. This level of choice allows you to select a unit that best suits your preferences and lifestyle, adding further value to your investment. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ### **Conclusion: Why Green Housing Is a Smart Choice for Today’s Homeowners**\n",
      "\n",
      "Opting for a home loan to purchase an under-construction property has several advantages, from lower upfront costs and tax benefits to appreciation potential and greater flexibility. It’s an investment that can yield long-term financial gains while providing you with a home tailored to your needs. Before proceeding, however, it’s crucial to evaluate the builder’s reputation, understand the payment terms, and assess the projected timeline to make sure the project aligns with your financial goals.\n",

      "- To convert from an [adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp) to a [fixed-rate mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-rate_mortgage.asp), or vice versa\n",

      "Embedding ### Key Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "- Refinancing your home mortgage can make sense under different scenarios.\n",
      "- You may be able to get a significantly lower mortgage rate, reducing your monthly payments and freeing up cash for other purposes.\n",
      "- You may also be able to shorten the term of your loan, allowing you to pay it off sooner.\n",
      "- A cash-out refinancing is a way to tap the equity in your home without selling it. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## When Should You Refinance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Refinancing your mortgage is a big step. As such, there are several things you should consider before you sign the paperwork. Most borrowers consider [mortgage rates](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5184598) they want to refinance. Locking in a lower rate is an important factor to consider when you want to refinance because it effectively lowers your payments. But it shouldn't be the only thing to focus on when you want to renew your mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few other factors to consider before you apply:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Your [home equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/home_equity.asp). Make sure you have equity available in your home. This is key if the value of your home drops below the value when you purchased it. It's also important to note that many lenders (especially conventional lenders) won't refinance your mortgage if you don't have enough equity in your home.\n",
      "- Your credit history. You won't qualify for a refinance if your [credit score](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) doesn't meet the minimum requirements. Take the time to build up your credit score before you apply.\n",
      "- Refinancing costs. If you have a mortgage, you'll know how much you paid in additional costs. As such, you'll have to pay these expenses again—usually a small percentage of the loan. Try to find ways to negotiate so you can reduce the costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other points you'll want to note are your [debt-to-income (DTI) ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp), the overall term of the refinance, and whether you qualify for refinance points to reduce the interest rate on the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask yourself if refinancing makes sense. How long do you intend to occupy the property? Will you end up saving more money if you refinance? Answering these questions will help you decide whether or not you should take this step. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Refinancing for a Lower Interest Rate\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best and most common reasons to [refinance](https://www.investopedia.com/best-mortgage-refinance-companies-5092956) is to lower your loan's interest rate. Historically, the rule of thumb has been that refinancing is a good idea if you can reduce your interest rate by at least 2%. However, many lenders say 1% savings is enough of an incentive to refinance. Using a mortgage calculator can help you see how much you might save.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lower interest rate will save you on short- and long-term interest while reducing your monthly payments. For example, a $100,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 7% has a principal and interest payment of $665. That same loan at 5% reduces your payment to $536.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculate Your Monthly Payment\n",
      "\n",
      "Your monthly mortgage payment will depend on your home price, down payment, loan term, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and interest rate on the loan (which is highly dependent on your credit score). Use the inputs below to get a sense of what your monthly mortgage payment could end up being.\n",

      "\n",
      "When [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5094943) fall, homeowners sometimes have the opportunity to refinance an existing loan for another loan that, without much change in the monthly payment, has a significantly shorter term and can save them a considerable amount of interest over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, suppose you purchased a $200,000 home with 20% ($40,000) down and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for $160,000 at 8%. Using [Investopedia's mortgage calculator](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794), which also builds in some assumptions about property taxes and insurance, your monthly payments would be about $1,419, and over the course of the loan, you'd pay $262,648 in interest, making your total repayment $422,648.\n",
      "\n",
      "If interest rates dropped, and you could get a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6%, your monthly payments would rise to about $1,594. While that's $175 more than your current mortgage, you'd now own your home free and clear in 15 years. Plus, your total interest payments would be just $83,030.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this simplified example doesn't account for the fact that whatever payments you had already made on your 30-year mortgage would have reduced the outstanding balance of your loan to some degree, so when you took out the 15-year mortgage, you wouldn't need to borrow the full $160,000.

      "While adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) often start with lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages, periodic adjustments can lead to rates as high as those available on new fixed-rate mortgages. Refinancing to a fixed-rate mortgage is a way to avoid future interest rate hikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, converting from a fixed-rate loan to a new ARM with a lower monthly payment can sometimes make sense, especially for homeowners who do not plan to stay in their homes for over a few years. Depending on the ARM, it may not adjust for the first five, seven, or even 10 years, making it essentially a fixed-rate loan for that period.1 to vector\n",

      "\n",
      "In cash-out refinancing, the homeowner takes out a mortgage larger than they currently owe, pays off the old mortgage, and pockets the remainder in cash. The cash can be used for any purpose, such as home remodeling, a child's college education, or to [consolidate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtconsolidation.asp) and pay off their other, higher-interest debts, such as credit cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside is that the cash comes at a cost, and the homeowner could be paying interest on it for many years. So, these loans aren't to be entered into lightly. In particular, homeowners may want to be judicious in how much cash they take out. For example, if a homeowner can cash out $100,000 by refinancing but only needs $25,000, there's no sense in borrowing (and paying interest on) the other $75,000. to vector\n",

      "Embedding ## When Should You Refinance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Refinancing your mortgage is a big step. As such, there are several things you should consider before you sign the paperwork. Most borrowers consider [mortgage rates](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5184598) they want to refinance. Locking in a lower rate is an important factor to consider when you want to refinance because it effectively lowers your payments. But it shouldn't be the only thing to focus on when you want to renew your mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few other factors to consider before you apply:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Your [home equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/home_equity.asp). Make sure you have equity available in your home. This is key if the value of your home drops below the value when you purchased it. It's also important to note that many lenders (especially conventional lenders) won't refinance your mortgage if you don't have enough equity in your home.\n",
      "- Your credit history. You won't qualify for a refinance if your [credit score](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) doesn't meet the minimum requirements. Take the time to build up your credit score before you apply.\n",
      "- Refinancing costs. If you have a mortgage, you'll know how much you paid in additional costs. As such, you'll have to pay these expenses again—usually a small percentage of the loan. Try to find ways to negotiate so you can reduce the costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other points you'll want to note are your [debt-to-income (DTI) ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp), the overall term of the refinance, and whether you qualify for refinance points to reduce the interest rate on the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask yourself if refinancing makes sense. How long do you intend to occupy the property? Will you end up saving more money if you refinance? Answering these questions will help you decide whether or not you should take this step. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Refinancing for a Lower Interest Rate\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best and most common reasons to [refinance](https://www.investopedia.com/best-mortgage-refinance-companies-5092956) is to lower your loan's interest rate. Historically, the rule of thumb has been that refinancing is a good idea if you can reduce your interest rate by at least 2%. However, many lenders say 1% savings is enough of an incentive to refinance. Using a mortgage calculator can help you see how much you might save.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lower interest rate will save you on short- and long-term interest while reducing your monthly payments. For example, a $100,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 7% has a principal and interest payment of $665. That same loan at 5% reduces your payment to $536. to vector\n",

      "When [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5094943) fall, homeowners sometimes have the opportunity to refinance an existing loan for another loan that, without much change in the monthly payment, has a significantly shorter term and can save them a considerable amount of interest over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, suppose you purchased a $200,000 home with 20% ($40,000) down and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for $160,000 at 8%. Using [Investopedia's mortgage calculator](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794), which also builds in some assumptions about property taxes and insurance, your monthly payments would be about $1,419, and over the course of the loan, you'd pay $262,648 in interest, making your total repayment $422,648.\n",
      "\n",
      "If interest rates dropped, and you could get a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6%, your monthly payments would rise to about $1,594. While that's $175 more than your current mortgage, you'd now own your home free and clear in 15 years. Plus, your total interest payments would be just $83,030.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this simplified example doesn't account for the fact that whatever payments you had already made on your 30-year mortgage would have reduced the outstanding balance of your loan to some degree, so when you took out the 15-year mortgage, you wouldn't need to borrow the full $160,000. In other words, your savings could be even greater.\n",

      "\n",
      "While adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) often start with lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages, periodic adjustments can lead to rates as high as those available on new fixed-rate mortgages. Refinancing to a fixed-rate mortgage is a way to avoid future interest rate hikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, converting from a fixed-rate loan to a new ARM with a lower monthly payment can sometimes make sense, especially for homeowners who do not plan to stay in their homes for over a few years. Depending on the ARM, it may not adjust for the first five, seven, or even 10 years, making it essentially a fixed-rate loan for that period.1 to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Refinancing to Tap Equity or Consolidate Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "Homeowners can also refinance as a way of tapping some of the equity that has built up in their homes over the years through what is known as a [cash-out refinancing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashout_refinance.asp).\n",
      "\n",
      "In cash-out refinancing, the homeowner takes out a mortgage larger than they currently owe, pays off the old mortgage, and pockets the remainder in cash. The cash can be used for any purpose, such as home remodeling, a child's college education, or to [consolidate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtconsolidation.asp) and pay off their other, higher-interest debts, such as credit cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside is that the cash comes at a cost, and the homeowner could be paying interest on it for many years. So, these loans aren't to be entered into lightly. In particular, homeowners may want to be judicious in how much cash they take out. For example, if a homeowner can cash out $100,000 by refinancing but only needs $25,000, there's no sense in borrowing (and paying interest on) the other $75,000. to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## What Credit Score Do You Need to Refinance a Mortgage?\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases you'll need a credit score of at least 620 to qualify for refinancing.2 However, there are exceptions, such as [FHA loans](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-an-fha-cash-out-refinance-5198645), where lower scores may be acceptable.3 to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Is Mortgage Interest Tax Deductible in a Refinancing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the mortgage interest for a homeowner's main home is tax-deductible, up to certain limits. Homeowners who are married and file taxes jointly may generally deduct the interest on up to $750,000 in mortgage debts; for single filers, the limit is $375,000. The rules for deducting interest on second homes are more complicated, depending on how the home is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, to claim mortgage interest as a tax deduction, the homeowner must [itemize](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/itemizeddeduction.asp) deductions on their taxes rather than claim the [standard deduction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp).4 The standard deduction was raised significantly in 2017, so many taxpayers no longer find it advantageous to itemize.5 to vector\n",
      "Embedding ## Are Mortgage Points Deductible in a Refinancing?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Mortgage points](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-points-what-are-they-are-they-worth-it-8668786), a form of prepaid interest, are deductible in refinancing, just as with an original mortgage. In most cases, they must be spread out and deducted over the life of the loan. The exception is if the refinancing was used for home improvements to your main home; in that case, you may be eligible to deduct them in the year you paid them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with other mortgage interest, points are deductible only if you itemize your deductions.6 to vector\n",

Tobin said that over the next six months, mortgage rates are expected to decline steeply. According to Freddie Mac, mortgage rates are closer to 6.5% than they are to 7%. Moreover, as consumer demand is expected to increase in the spring season, the outlook for housing ahead of 2024, especially over the first six months seems to be positive.

The Federal Reserve maintained a relatively high federal funds rate throughout the year, aiming to stabilize inflation without drastically impacting economic growth([10)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm). As a result, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hovered around 6.8%([11)](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms). While this was a slight improvement from 2023’s highs, it remained well above pre-pandemic levels, making home financing less affordable for many borrowers.\\n\\nThese elevated rates placed downward pressure on both purchasing power and housing affordability.

Changes in the benchmark short-term interest rate can lead to fluctuations in long-term rates, such as those for mortgages.\\n\\n2. **Investor Expectations**: Market expectations about future economic conditions, including inflation and growth, can influence mortgage rates. If investors anticipate rising inflation, they may demand higher yields on bonds, which in turn can push mortgage rates up.\\n\\n3. **10-Year Treasury Yields**: Mortgage rates closely track the yields on 10-year Treasury notes. As these yields rise or fall, mortgage rates tend to follow suit.\\n\\n4. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as inflation rates, unemployment rates, and job market performance can also affect mortgage rates. Strong indicators may lead to higher rates, while weak indicators may result in lower rates.\\n\\n5. **Geopolitical Events**: Political instability, military conflicts, and elections can create economic uncertainty, which can lead to volatility in mortgage rates.\\n\\n6. **Credit Score and Financial Profile**: A borrower's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and overall financial health can influence the interest rates offered by lenders. Borrowers with higher credit scores typically qualify for lower rates.\\n\\n7. **Loan Characteristics**: The type of loan—such as fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as the size of the loan and down payment—can impact the interest rate. Larger down payments and lower-risk loans often receive better rates.\\n\\n8. **Market Competition**: The level of competition among lenders may also affect mortgage rates, as lenders may offer more attractive rates to attract borrowers. \\n\\nThese factors collectively create a dynamic environment that influences mortgage interest rates at any given time.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Interest rates can vary across different states or regions due to several factors, including:\\n\\n1. **Local Economic Conditions**: States with stronger economies often have lower interest rates because lenders feel more secure in borrowers' ability to repay loans. Conversely, regions facing economic challenges may see higher rates to compensate for increased risk.\\n\\n2. **Cost of Living**: Areas with a higher cost of living might have higher interest rates. Lenders take into account the financial pressures borrowers face, which can differ by location.\\n\\n3. **Housing Market Dynamics**: In regions with rapidly appreciating home prices, lenders may adjust rates based on perceived risk and competition among borrowers, leading to variations in mortgage rates.\\n\\n4. **State Regulations**: Some states have unique regulations that affect lending practices, which can influence interest rates. For instance, states may impose usury laws that limit the maximum interest rate lenders can charge.\\n\\n5. **Local Competition**: Regions with a higher number of lenders can experience lower rates due to increased competition among financial institutions. Conversely, in areas with fewer lenders, rates may be higher due to less competition.\\n\\n6. **Property Taxes and Insurance Costs**: Locations with high property taxes or insurance costs can lead to higher overall borrowing costs, indirectly affecting interest rates offered by lenders.\\n\\n7. **Credit Unions and Regional Banks**: Local financial institutions may offer more competitive rates compared to national banks, reflecting their understanding of the regional market and borrower needs.\\n\\n8. **Loan Type and Purpose**: Different regions may have varying demand for types of loans (e.g., conventional, FHA, VA loans), which can influence the rates lenders provide.\\n\\nAs a result of these factors, it's essential for borrowers to shop around and compare offers from various lenders in their specific region to find the best rates available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Inflation significantly affects home loan interest rates in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Federal Reserve Response**: In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve often raises the federal funds rate to cool the economy. Higher federal funds rates generally lead to increased mortgage rates as lenders pass on the higher costs of borrowing to consumers.\\n\\n2. **Investor Expectations**: Mortgage rates are influenced by investor expectations about the economy and future inflation. If investors anticipate higher inflation, they may demand higher yields on bonds, leading to increased mortgage rates.\\n\\n3. **General Economic Conditions**: Inflation can cause higher living costs, which in turn affects household budgets. As consumers allocate more of their income towards essential expenses, the amount they can afford for mortgage payments may decrease, impacting overall demand for home loans.\\n\\n4. **Current Rate Environment**: In the current context, even though inflation has shown signs of moderation, it remained above the Federal Reserve's target, prompting the central bank to maintain elevated interest rates. This situation continues to sustain higher mortgage rates, presenting challenges for homebuyers seeking affordability.\\n\\n5. **Historical Context**: Historically, mortgage rates tend to be higher during periods of high inflation. For example, after a significant inflation surge, mortgage rates rose sharply, contributing to lower homebuying demand due to affordability concerns.\\n\\nIn summary, inflation impacts mortgage interest rates primarily through the actions of the Federal Reserve, investor expectations, and overall economic conditions, influencing both the rates themselves and the broader housing market dynamics.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Document: \\n + Content: ### Inflation’s Role in Mortgage Rates and Borrower Concerns\\n\\nInflation continued to play a critical role in shaping mortgage rates in 2024. Although inflation showed signs of moderating, it remained above the Federal Reserve’s target, prompting the central bank to keep rates elevated as a preventive measure against further economic overheating([14)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm). This decision indirectly sustained higher mortgage rates, creating additional obstacles for buyers seeking affordability. High inflation affected not only interest rates but also general living costs, which placed further strain on household budgets and limited the portion of income many households could allocate toward mortgage payments.\\n\\nBrokers reported that many clients expressed concerns about the high rates, particularly those new to homeownership who lacked familiarity with rate fluctuations.

By December 2023, this rate had risen to 7.169%, indicating a steady increase in interest rates throughout the year. This rise in interest rates has contributed to higher monthly mortgage payments for borrowers and has impacted overall mortgage market activity, including a decline in both home purchase and refinance loan applications and originations.   \n",
       "2                                             Home loan interest rates are influenced by several key factors, including:\\n\\n1. **Federal Reserve Policies**: The Federal Reserve's decisions regarding interest rates impact mortgage rates. Changes in the benchmark short-term interest rate can lead to fluctuations in long-term rates, such as those for mortgages.\\n\\n2. **Investor Expectations**: Market expectations about future economic conditions, including inflation and growth, can influence mortgage rates. If investors anticipate rising inflation, they may demand higher yields on bonds, which in turn can push mortgage rates up.\\n\\n3. **10-Year Treasury Yields**: Mortgage rates closely track the yields on 10-year Treasury notes. As these yields rise or fall, mortgage rates tend to follow suit.\\n\\n4. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as inflation rates, unemployment rates, and job market performance can also affect mortgage rates. Strong indicators may lead to higher rates, while weak indicators may result in lower rates.\\n\\n5. **Geopolitical Events**: Political instability, military conflicts, and elections can create economic uncertainty, which can lead to volatility in mortgage rates.\\n\\n6. **Credit Score and Financial Profile**: A borrower's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and overall financial health can influence the interest rates offered by lenders. Borrowers with higher credit scores typically qualify for lower rates.\\n\\n7. **Loan Characteristics**: The type of loan—such as fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as the size of the loan and down payment—can impact the interest rate. Larger down payments and lower-risk loans often receive better rates.\\n\\n8. **Market Competition**: The level of competition among lenders may also affect mortgage rates, as lenders may offer more attractive rates to attract borrowers. \\n\\nThese factors collectively create a dynamic environment that influences mortgage interest rates at any given time.   \n",
       "3  Interest rates can vary across different states or regions due to several factors, including:\\n\\n1. **Local Economic Conditions**: States with stronger economies often have lower interest rates because lenders feel more secure in borrowers' ability to repay loans. Conversely, regions facing economic challenges may see higher rates to compensate for increased risk.\\n\\n2. **Cost of Living**: Areas with a higher cost of living might have higher interest rates. Lenders take into account the financial pressures borrowers face, which can differ by location.\\n\\n3. **Housing Market Dynamics**: In regions with rapidly appreciating home prices, lenders may adjust rates based on perceived risk and competition among borrowers, leading to variations in mortgage rates.\\n\\n4. **State Regulations**: Some states have unique regulations that affect lending practices, which can influence interest rates. For instance, states may impose usury laws that limit the maximum interest rate lenders can charge.\\n\\n5. **Local Competition**: Regions with a higher number of lenders can experience lower rates due to increased competition among financial institutions. Conversely, in areas with fewer lenders, rates may be higher due to less competition.\\n\\n6. **Property Taxes and Insurance Costs**: Locations with high property taxes or insurance costs can lead to higher overall borrowing costs, indirectly affecting interest rates offered by lenders.\\n\\n7. **Credit Unions and Regional Banks**: Local financial institutions may offer more competitive rates compared to national banks, reflecting their understanding of the regional market and borrower needs.\\n\\n8. **Loan Type and Purpose**: Different regions may have varying demand for types of loans (e.g., conventional, FHA, VA loans), which can influence the rates lenders provide.\\n\\nAs a result of these factors, it's essential for borrowers to shop around and compare offers from various lenders in their specific region to find the best rates available.   \n",

Higher federal funds rates generally lead to increased mortgage rates as lenders pass on the higher costs of borrowing to consumers.\\n\\n2. **Investor Expectations**: Mortgage rates are influenced by investor expectations about the economy and future inflation. If investors anticipate higher inflation, they may demand higher yields on bonds, leading to increased mortgage rates.\\n\\n3. **General Economic Conditions**: Inflation can cause higher living costs, which in turn affects household budgets. As consumers allocate more of their income towards essential expenses, the amount they can afford for mortgage payments may decrease, impacting overall demand for home loans.\\n\\n4. **Current Rate Environment**: In the current context, even though inflation has shown signs of moderation, it remained above the Federal Reserve's target, prompting the central bank to maintain elevated interest rates. This situation continues to sustain higher mortgage rates, presenting challenges for homebuyers seeking affordability.\\n\\n5. **Historical Context**: Historically, mortgage rates tend to be higher during periods of high inflation. For example, after a significant inflation surge, mortgage rates rose sharply, contributing to lower homebuying demand due to affordability concerns.\\n\\nIn summary, inflation impacts mortgage interest rates primarily through the actions of the Federal Reserve, investor expectations, and overall economic conditions, influencing both the rates themselves and the broader housing market dynamics.   \n",

Tobin said that over the next six months, mortgage rates are expected to decline steeply. According to Freddie Mac, mortgage rates are closer to 6.5% than they are to 7%. Moreover, as consumer demand is expected to increase in the spring season, the outlook for housing ahead of 2024, especially over the first six months seems to be positive. Over the past few months, mortgage rates have declined by one full percentage point. Other important catalysts expected to shape the housing outlook include the vast builder incentives, including price cuts and the expected drop in mortgage rates to lower than 6%.\\n\\nOn January 25, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us   \n",

The Federal Reserve maintained a relatively high federal funds rate throughout the year, aiming to stabilize inflation without drastically impacting economic growth([10)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2024-03-mpr-summary.htm). As a result, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hovered around 6.8%([11)](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms). While this was a slight improvement from 2023’s highs, it remained well above pre-pandemic levels, making home financing less affordable for many borrowers.\\n\\nThese elevated rates placed downward pressure on both purchasing power and housing affordability.
